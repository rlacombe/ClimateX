For the Southern Ocean in CMIP5, considerable fresh biases exist through the water column, and are most pronounced in the ventilated layers representing the subtropical mode and intermediate water masses (Sallée et al., 2013). A fresh bias in upper and intermediate layers of comparable magnitude is also seen in CMIP6 (Figure 3.25). The structure of the biases in the CMIP6 multi-model mean (which averages across many simulations with differing subsurface geographies and differing Southern Ocean salinity biases (Beadling et al., 2020)) is similar to that evident in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, but with slightly smaller magnitudes. The Arctic Ocean also on average exhibits a surface-enhanced fresh bias in the upper ocean (Figure 3.25), which is much larger than its Southern Hemisphere counterpart. In summary, the structure of the salinity biases in the multi-model mean has not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence), though there is limited evidence that the magnitude of subsurface biases has been reduced.

The forced response is dependent on the strength, seasonal timing and location of the eruption but may also depend on the mean climate background state (Zanchettin et al., 2013) and/or the phases of the main modes of decadal variability such as the AMV (Section 3.7.7; Ménégoz et al., 2018). Finally, there is some evidence of an apparent signal-to-noise problem referred to as ‘paradox’ in seasonal and decadal hindcasts of the NAO over the period 1979–2018 (Scaife and Smith, 2018), which suggests that the NAO response to external forcing, SST or sea ice anomalies could be too weak in models. The weakness of the signal has been related to troposphere-stratosphere coupling which is too intermittent (O’Reilly et al., 2019b) and to chronic model biases in the persistence of NAO/NAM daily regimes, which is critically underestimated in coupled models (Strommen and Palmer, 2019; Zhang and Kirtman, 2019), and which does not exhibit significant improvement when model resolution is increased (Fabiano et al., 2020).

This is the case as the regional trends in the maximum northward extent of the ice cover (Figure 9.15) are determined by the balance between the northward advection of the ice that is formed in polynyas near the continental margin, and the lateral and subsurface melting through oceanic heat fluxes. The advection of the sea ice is strongly correlated with winds and cyclones (Schemm, 2018; Vichi et al., 2019; Alberello et al., 2020). Accordingly, the increasing sea ice area in the Ross Sea can be linked to a strengthening of the Amundsen Sea low (e.g., Holland et al., 2017b, 2018), while other regional sea ice trends in the austral autumn can be linked to changes in westerly winds, cyclone activity and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in summer and spring (Doddridge and Marshall, 2017; Holland et al., 2017a; Schemm, 2018). In addition to the wind-driven changes, increased near-surface ocean stratification (Section 9.2.1.3) has contributed to the observed increase in sea ice coverage (e.g., Purich et al., 2018; L.

Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators outperform uncorrected output of global and regional models for a range of statistical aspects at single locations due to their calibration (Casanueva et al., 2016), but RCMs are superior when spatial fields are relevant (Mehrotra et al., 2014; Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Maraun et al., 2019a). Similarly, there is some evidence that bias adjustment is comparable in performance when applied to global models and dynamically downscaled global models only for single locations, but dynamical downscaling prior to bias adjustment clearly adds value once spatial dependence is relevant (Maraun et al., 2019a). These results may explain why dynamical downscaling does not add value to global model simulations for (single-site) agricultural modelling, when both global and regional models are bias adjusted (Glotter et al., 2014), but dynamical downscaling adds value compared to bias-adjusted global model output for spatially distributed hydrological models (Qiao et al., 2014).

It assesses differential sensitivities among life stages within individual organisms, changing responses across scales of biological organisation and the potential for evolutionary adaptation to climate change (e.g., Przeslawski et al., 2015; Boyd et al., 2018; Reddin et al., 2020), providing examples and identifying key gaps and uncertainties that limit our ability to project the ecological impact of multiple climate-induced drivers (Figure 3.8a). The assessment includes physiological responses to single environmental drivers and their underlying mechanisms (Section 3.3.2), the characteristics of multiple drivers and organisms’ responses to them (Section 3.3.3), short-term acclimation and longer-term evolutionary adaptation of populations (Section 3.3.4), and it concludes with an assessment of progress in upscaling laboratory findings to ecosystems within in situ settings (Figure 3.8b; Section 3.3.5). 3.3.2 Responses to Single Drivers Anthropogenic CO 2 emissions trigger a suite of changes that alter ocean temperature, pH and CO 2 concentration, oxygen concentration and nutrient supply at global scales (Section 3.2). The response pathways of these climate-induced drivers have been investigated primarily as single variables.

Abrupt ecosystem shifts are associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability (Alheit et al., 2019; Beaugrand et al., 2019; Lehodey et al., 2020), some of which are projected to intensify with climate change (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter 1; Wang et al., 2017a; Collins et al., 2019a; Chen et al., 2021). Over the past 60 years, abrupt ecosystem shifts have generally followed El Niño/ Southern Oscillation events of any strength, but some periods had geographically limited ecological shifts (~0.25% of the global ocean in 1984–1987) and others more extensive shifts (14% of the global ocean in 2012–2015) (medium confidence) (Figure 3.19b; Beaugrand et al., 2019). Typically, interacting drivers, such as eutrophication and overharvest, reduce ecosystem resilience to climate extremes (e.g., MHWs, cyclones) or gradual warming, and hence promote ecosystem shifts (high confidence) (Figure 3.19a; Rocha et al., 2015; Biggs et al., 2018; Babcock et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2020b; Bergstrom et al., 2021; Canadell and Jackson, 2021; Tait et al., 2021).

Since SROCC, coastal adaptation using NbS, like restoration of coastal vegetation, has advanced substantially (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2019; Kuhl et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020a). Field and modelling studies confirm that wetland restoration and preservation are key actions to restore coastal protection and reduce community vulnerability to flooding (very high confidence) (see also Section 3.6; Chapter 15; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Jones et al., 2020; Menéndez et al., 2020; Van Coppenolle and Temmerman, 2020), while maintaining coastal ecosystem services (Section 3.5). Restoring coral reefs, oyster reefs and mangroves (Section 3.6.2.1) and protecting macrophyte meadows dissipates wave energy (Section 3.4.2.1; Yates et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018; Wiberg et al., 2019; Menéndez et al., 2020), accretes sediment and elevate shorelines, which reduces exposure to waves and storm surges, and offsets erosional losses (medium confidence) (Kench and Mann, 2017; Pomeroy et al., 2018; Dasgupta et al., 2019; James et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019; David and Schlurmann, 2020; Masselink et al., 2020). However, irreversible regime shifts in ocean ecosystems due to SLR and extreme events, such as MHWs, can limit or compromise restoration in the long term (high confidence) (Section 3.4.3.3.3; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Marzloff et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2017a).",False,high,high,"[('high', -0.07087127, 93.16), ('very', -3.0708714, 4.64), ('medium', -3.9458714, 1.93), ('High', -6.4458714, 0.16), ('Statement', -8.070871, 0.03)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.04575304, 95.53), ('very', -3.420753, 3.27), ('medium', -4.545753, 1.06), ('Confidence', -7.170753, 0.08), (""'"", -8.2957535, 0.02)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.05369017, 94.77), ('very', -3.5536902, 2.86), ('medium', -3.8036902, 2.23), (""'"", -7.30369, 0.07), ('Confidence', -8.30369, 0.02)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.120979436, 88.61), ('Confidence', -2.8709795, 5.66), ('medium', -3.6209795, 2.68), ('very', -3.6209795, 2.68), ('Statement', -6.1209793, 0.22)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.040106885, 96.07), ('very', -3.6651068, 2.56), ('medium', -5.040107, 0.65), ('Confidence', -5.665107, 0.35), ('Statement', -6.290107, 0.19)]"

The economic impacts of droughts have been associated with increases in suicide, particularly among farmers (Carleton, 2017; Edwards et al., 2015; Vins et al., 2015); those whose occupations are likely to be affected by climate change report that it is a source of stress that is linked to substance abuse and suicidal ideation (Kabir, 2018). Studies of Indigenous Peoples often describe food insecurity or reduced access to traditional foods as a link between climate change and reduced mental health (Middleton et al., 2020b). The loss of family members, for example due to an extreme weather event, increases the risk of mental illness (Keyes et al., 2014).

The result of this broad framing linking economic growth to human well- being has been decades of policies, programmes and projects aimed at growing economies at scales from the household to regional and global. However, linking development to past and current modes of economic growth creates significant challenges for CRD, as it implies that the very processes that have contributed to current climate challenges, including economic growth and the resource use and energy regimes it relies upon, are also the pathways to improvements in human well-being. This places climate resilience and development in opposition to one another.

This inadvertent impact on equity appears to fundamentally contradict a benevolent understanding of transformative adaptation that also champions social justice (Patterson et al., 2018), thus posing long-term maladaptation in opposition to transformative adaptation (Magnan et al., 2020). Similarly, mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions, can also increase climate impacts vulnerability and undermine adaptation efforts. The same can be said for some poverty alleviation and sustainable development efforts that increase vulnerability for specific segments of the population. For example, in Central America, an evaluation of 12 rural renewable energy projects (either forthe clean development mechanism, early warning systems or rural electrification goals) found that some mitigation and poverty alleviation projects increased vulnerability to families—by excluding them, not adhering to local safety and quality codes and standards, or significantly altering community power dynamics and contributing to conflict (Ley, 2017; Ley et al., 2020).

However, all emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions.",False,high,high,"[('high', -0.16927157, 84.43), ('very', -1.9192716, 14.67), ('medium', -4.7942715, 0.83), ('Statement', -7.5442715, 0.05), ('low', -9.669271, 0.01)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.07932331, 92.37), ('very', -2.8293233, 5.91), ('medium', -4.0793233, 1.69), ('low', -9.204324, 0.01), (""'"", -9.454324, 0.01)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.058725752, 94.3), ('medium', -3.3087258, 3.66), ('very', -3.9337258, 1.96), (""'"", -7.933726, 0.04), ('Statement', -8.183725, 0.03)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.04229999, 95.86), ('very', -3.6673, 2.55), ('medium', -4.1673, 1.55), ('low', -8.9173, 0.01), (""'"", -9.1673, 0.01)]",high,high,"[('high', -0.058725752, 94.3), ('medium', -3.3087258, 3.66), ('very', -3.9337258, 1.96), (""'"", -7.933726, 0.04), ('Statement', -8.183725, 0.03)]"
