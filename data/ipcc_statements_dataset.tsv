13	AR6_WGI	25	1	Over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa, increases in monsoon precipitation due to warming from GHG emissions were counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation due to cooling from human-caused aerosol emissions over the 20th century	high	2	train
14	AR6_WGI	25	2	Increases in West African monsoon precipitation since the 1980s are partly due to the growing influence of GHGs and reductions in the cooling effect of human-caused aerosol emissions over Europe and North America	medium	1	train

23	AR6_WGI	31	7	For example, every additional 0.5°C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, including heatwaves (very likely), and heavy precipitation (high confidence), as well as agricultural and ecological droughts30 in some regions	high	2	train

33	AR6_WGI	36	1	This is projected to result in a higher proportion of emitted CO 2 remaining in the atmosphere	high	2	train
34	AR6_WGI	36	3	Under the very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6), where CO 2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (high confidence) and turn into a weak net source by 2100 under SSP1-1.9	medium	1	train
35	AR6_WGI	36	4	It is very unlikely that the combined global land and ocean sink will turn into a source by 2100 under scenarios without net negative emissions (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).32 {4.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, Box TS.5, TS.3.3} B.4.3 The magnitude of feedbacks between climate change and the carbon cycle becomes larger but also more uncertain in high CO 2 emissions scenarios	very high	3	train
36	AR6_WGI	36	5	However, climate model projections show that the uncertainties in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations by 2100 are dominated by the differences between emissions scenarios	high	2	train
37	AR6_WGI	36	6	Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere	high	2	train

41	AR6_WGI	37	14	Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2100 is 0.28–0.55 m under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9); 0.32–0.62 m under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6); 0.44–0.76 m under the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5); and 0.63–1.01 m under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); and by 2150 is 0.37–0.86 m under the very low scenario (SSP1-1.9); 0.46–0.99 m under the low scenario (SSP1-2.6); 0.66–1.33 m under the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5); and 0.98–1.88 m under the very high scenario (SSP5-8.5) (medium confidence).35 Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and 5 m by 2150 under a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)	low	0	train
42	AR6_WGI	37	16	Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C, 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C and 19 to 22 m with 5°C of warming, and it will continue to rise over subsequent millennia	low	0	test
43	AR6_WGI	37	17	Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: likely 5–10 m higher than today around 125,000 years ago, when global temperatures were very likely 0.5°C–1.5°C higher than 1850–1900; and very likely 5–25 m higher roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C–4°C higher	medium	1	train
44	AR6_WGI	39	32	For example, internal decadal variability and variations in solar and volcanic drivers partially masked human-caused surface global warming during 1998–2012, with pronounced regional and seasonal signatures	high	2	train
45	AR6_WGI	39	33	Nonetheless, the heating of the climate system continued during this period, as reflected in both the continued warming of the global ocean (very high confidence) and in the continued rise of hot extremes over land	medium	1	train
46	AR6_WGI	40	1	At global and regional scales, near-term changes in monsoons will be dominated by the effects of internal variability	medium	1	train
47	AR6_WGI	40	2	In addition to the influence of internal variability, near-term projected changes in precipitation at global and regional scales are uncertain because of model uncertainty and uncertainty in forcings from natural and anthropogenic aerosols	medium	1	train
48	AR6_WGI	40	8	Further decreases are projected in permafrost; snow, glaciers and ice sheets; and lake and Arctic sea ice (medium to high confidence).40 These changes would be larger at 2°C global warming or above than at 1.5°C	high	2	train
49	AR6_WGI	40	9	For example, extreme heat thresholds relevant to agriculture and health are projected to be exceeded more frequently at higher global warming levels	high	2	train
50	AR6_WGI	40	11	Also, more frequent and/or severe agricultural and ecological droughts are projected in a few regions in all inhabited continents except Asia compared to 1850–1900 (medium confidence); increases in meteorological droughts are also projected in a few regions	medium	1	train

58	AR6_WGI	41	5	Relative sea level rise contributes to increases in the frequency and severity of coastal flooding in low-lying areas and to coastal erosion along most sandy coasts	high	2	train
59	AR6_WGI	41	7	Urbanization also increases mean and heavy precipitation over and/or downwind of cities (medium confidence) and resulting runoff intensity	high	2	train
60	AR6_WGI	41	8	In coastal cities, the combination of more frequent extreme sea level events (due to sea level rise and storm surge) and extreme rainfall/ riverflow events will make flooding more probable	high	2	train
61	AR6_WGI	41	11	Concurrent extremes at multiple locations, including in crop-producing areas, become more frequent at 2°C and above compared to 1.5°C global warming	high	2	train
62	AR6_WGI	43	4	The probability of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes increases with higher global warming levels	high	2	train
63	AR6_WGI	43	5	Abrupt responses and tipping points of the climate system, such as strongly increased Antarctic ice-sheet melt and forest dieback, cannot be ruled out	high	2	train
64	AR6_WGI	45	13	When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, estimates of remaining carbon budgets are therefore of similar magnitude compared to SR1.5 but larger compared to AR5 due to methodological improvements.44 {5.5, Box 5.2, TS.3.3} (Table SPM.2) D.1.4 Anthropogenic CO 2 removal (CDR) has the potential to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in reservoirs	high	2	train
65	AR6_WGI	45	15	CDR methods can have potentially wide-ranging effects on biogeochemical cycles and climate, which can either weaken or strengthen the potential of these methods to remove CO 2 and reduce warming, and can also influence water availability and quality, food production and biodiversity45	high	2	train
66	AR6_WGI	46	1	CDR would lower atmospheric CO 2 by an amount approximately equal to the increase from an anthropogenic emission of the same magnitude	high	2	train
67	AR6_WGI	46	2	The atmospheric CO 2 decrease from anthropogenic CO 2 removals could be up to 10% less than the atmospheric CO 2 increase from an equal amount of CO 2 emissions, depending on the total amount of CDR	medium	1	train
68	AR6_WGI	46	4	For instance, it would take several centuries to millennia for global mean sea level to reverse course even under large net negative CO 2 emissions	high	2	train
69	AR6_WGI	46	6	In the long term, this net warming is lower in scenarios assuming air pollution controls combined with strong and sustained CH 4 emissions reductions	high	2	train
70	AR6_WGI	46	8	Because of the short lifetime of both CH 4 and aerosols, these climate effects partially counterbalance each other, and reductions in CH 4 emissions also contribute to improved air quality by reducing global surface ozone	high	2	train
71	AR6_WGI	46	12	Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential are projected to result in a decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak	high	2	train
72	AR6_WGI	46	14	Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years, and over longer time periods for many other climatic impact-drivers	high	2	train
73	AR6_WGI	46	16	Global and regional climate responses to this temporary forcing are, however, undetectable above natural variability	high	2	train
74	AR6_WGI	46	17	Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations continued to rise in 2020, with no detectable decrease in the observed CO 2 growth rate	medium	1	train
75	AR6_WGI	47	1	Scenarios with targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but from 2040, further improvements are projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions, with the magnitude of the benefit varying between regions	high	2	train
76	AR6_WGI	47	5	The response of many other climate variables would emerge from natural variability at different times later in the 21st century	high	2	train
77	AR6_WGI	47	7	By the end of the century, scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions would strongly limit the change of several CIDs, such as the increases in the frequency of extreme sea level events, heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding, and exceedance of dangerous heat thresholds, while limiting the number of regions where such exceedances occur, relative to higher GHG emissions scenarios	high	2	test
78	AR6_WGI	47	8	Changes would also be smaller in very low compared to low GHG emissions scenarios, as well as for intermediate (SSP2-4.5) compared to high or very high GHG emissions scenarios	high	2	train
79	AR6_WGI	57	25	Since 2012, strong warming has been observed, with the past five years (2016–2020) being the hottest five- year period in the instrumental record since at least 1850	high	2	train
80	AR6_WGI	62	1	Changes in temperature by latitude in response to multiple forcings show that polar amplification (stronger warming at high latitudes than the global average) is a prominent feature of the climate system across multiple climate states, and the ability of models to simulate this polar amplification in past warm climates has improved since AR5	high	2	train
81	AR6_WGI	62	2	Over the past millennium, and especially since about 1300 CE, simulated global surface temperature anomalies are well within the uncertainty of reconstructions	medium	1	test

83	AR6_WGI	62	15	Climate models are able to reproduce decadal drought variability on large regional scales, including the severity, persistence and spatial extent of past megadroughts known from proxy records	medium	1	train
84	AR6_WGI	63	1	Although past and future global warming differ in their forcings, evidence from paleoclimate records and modelling show that ice-sheet mass and global mean sea level (GMSL) responded dynamically over multiple millennia	high	2	train
85	AR6_WGI	63	3	For example, under a past global warming levels of around [2.5°C to 4°C] relative to 1850–1900, like during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, sea level was [5 to 25 m] higher than 1900 (medium confidence); under past global warming levels of [10°C to 18°C], like during the Early Eocene, the planet was essentially ice free	high	2	train
86	AR6_WGI	63	8	The paleo context supports the assessment that ongoing increase in ocean heat content (OHC) represents a long-term commitment, essentially irreversible on human time scales	high	2	test
87	AR6_WGI	63	16	At the same time, the storage of remineralized carbon in the ocean interior increased by as much as 750–950 PgC, sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere (200 PgC) and terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined	high	2	train
88	AR6_WGI	64	16	Increasing horizontal resolution in global climate models improves the representation of small-scale features and the statistics of daily precipitation	high	2	train
89	AR6_WGI	64	17	Earth system models, which include additional biogeochemical feedbacks, often perform as well as their lower-complexity global climate model counterparts, which do not account for these additional feedbacks	medium	1	train
90	AR6_WGI	64	26	Earth system models, characterized by additional biogeochemical feedbacks, often perform at least as well as related, more constrained, lower-complexity models lacking these feedbacks	medium	1	train
91	AR6_WGI	64	29	The CMIP6 models also reproduce surface temperature variations over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows periods of intense volcanism	medium	1	train
92	AR6_WGI	65	4	Because a negative cloud optical depth feedback in response to surface warming results from ‘brightening’ of clouds via active phase change from ice to liquid cloud particles (increasing their shortwave cloud radiative effect), the extratropical cloud shortwave feedback in CMIP6 models tends to be less negative, leading to a better agreement with observational estimates	medium	1	train
93	AR6_WGI	65	7	Increasing horizontal resolution in global climate models improves the representation of small-scale features and the statistics of daily precipitation	high	2	train
94	AR6_WGI	65	11	The overall performance of CMIP6 models in simulating the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation is similar to that of CMIP5 models	high	2	train
95	AR6_WGI	65	21	Models reproduce observed spatial features and variance of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Northern Annular Mode (NAM) very well	high	2	train
96	AR6_WGI	65	22	The summertime SAM trend is well captured, with CMIP6 models outperforming CMIP5 models	medium	1	train
97	AR6_WGI	65	25	Model performance is limited in reproducing sea surface temperature anomalies for decadal modes of variability, despite improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6	medium	1	train
98	AR6_WGI	65	30	These higher sensitivity values can, in some models, be traced to changes in extratropical cloud feedbacks	medium	1	test
99	AR6_WGI	66	12	The signal of temperature change has emerged more clearly in tropical regions, where year-to-year variations tend to be small over land, than in regions with greater warming but larger year- to-year variations	high	2	train
100	AR6_WGI	66	16	Global ocean heat content continued to increase throughout this period, indicating continuous warming of the entire climate system	very high	3	train
101	AR6_WGI	66	17	Hot extremes also continued to increase during this period over land	high	2	train
102	AR6_WGI	66	18	Even in a continually warming climate, periods of reduced and increased trends in global surface temperature at decadal time scales will continue to occur in the 21st century	very high	3	train
103	AR6_WGI	67	1	Simulations and understanding of modes of climate variability, including teleconnections, have improved since AR5	medium	1	train
104	AR6_WGI	67	3	While anthropogenic forcing has contributed to multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in several regions, internal variability can delay emergence of the anthropogenic signal in long-term precipitation changes in many land regions	high	2	train
105	AR6_WGI	67	6	Several impact-relevant changes have not yet emerged from natural variability but will emerge sooner or later in this century depending on the emissions scenario	high	2	train
106	AR6_WGI	67	7	Ocean acidification and deoxygenation have already emerged over most of the global open ocean, as has a reduction in Arctic sea ice	high	2	train
107	AR6_WGI	68	4	New techniques and analyses drawing on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and climate extremes to human influence	high	2	train
108	AR6_WGI	68	11	For example, the difference in observed warming trends between cities and their surroundings can partly be attributed to urbanization	very high	3	train
109	AR6_WGI	68	13	Multiple attribution approaches support the contribution of human influence to several regional multi-decadal mean precipitation changes	high	2	train
110	AR6_WGI	68	14	Understanding about past and future changes in weather and climate extremes has increased due to better observation-based datasets, physical understanding of processes, an increasing proportion of scientific literature combining different lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different types of climate models	high	2	train
111	AR6_WGI	71	8	In SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, changes in ERF also explain about half of the changes in the range of warming	medium	1	train
112	AR6_WGI	71	9	For SSP5-8.5, higher climate sensitivity is the primary reason behind the upper end of the CMIP6- projected warming being higher than for RCP8.5 in CMIP5	medium	1	train
113	AR6_WGI	71	14	The differences in the few ESMs for which both emissions and concentration-driven runs were available for the same scenario are small and do not affect the assessment of global surface temperature projections discussed in Cross-Section Box TS.1 and Section TS.2	high	2	train

118	AR6_WGI	75	12	Changes in GMST and GSAT over time differ by at most 10% in either direction	high	2	train
119	AR6_WGI	75	16	Temperatures as high as during the most recent decade (2011–2020) exceed the warmest centennial-scale range reconstructed for the present interglacial, around 6500 years ago [0.2°C to 1°C]	medium	1	train

259	AR6_WGI	107	5	Improved quantifications of ERF, the climate system radiative response, and the observed energy increase in the Earth system for the period 1971–2018 demonstrate improved closure of the global energy budget (i.e., the extent to which the sum of the integrated forcing and the integrated radiative response equals the energy gain of the Earth system) compared to AR5	high	2	train
260	AR6_WGI	108	6	Changes in sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions make the dominant contribution to the ERF from aerosol– cloud interactions	high	2	train
261	AR6_WGI	108	7	Over the 1750–2019 period, the contributions from the emitted compounds to global surface temperature changes broadly match their contributions to the ERF	high	2	train
262	AR6_WGI	109	1	The ERF due to aerosol– cloud interactions (ERFaci) contributes most to the magnitude of the total aerosol ERF (high confidence) and is assessed to be –1.0 [–1.7 to –0.3] W m–2 (medium confidence), with the remainder due to aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari), assessed to be –0.3 [–0.6 to 0.0] W m–2	medium	1	train
263	AR6_WGI	109	13	Feedback processes are expected to become more positive overall (more amplifying of global surface temperature changes) on multi-decadal time scales as the spatial pattern of surface warming evolves and global surface temperature increases, leading to an ECS that is higher than was inferred in AR5 based on warming over the instrumental record	high	2	train
264	AR6_WGI	109	15	Based on process understanding, climate modelling, and paleoclimate reconstructions of past warm periods, it is expected that future warming will become enhanced over the eastern Pacific Ocean (medium confidence) and Southern Ocean	high	2	train

268	AR6_WGI	113	7	This near-linear relationship further implies that mitigation requirements for limiting warming to specific levels can be quantified in terms of a carbon budget	high	2	train
269	AR6_WGI	113	9	Several factors, including estimates of historical warming, future emissions from thawing permafrost, variations in projected non-CO 2 warming, and the global surface temperature change after cessation of CO 2 emissions, affect the exact value of carbon budgets	high	2	train
270	AR6_WGI	115	14	In the same way that part of current anthropogenic net CO 2 emissions are taken up by land and ocean carbon stores, net CO 2 removal will be partially counteracted by CO 2 release from these stores	very high	3	train
271	AR6_WGI	115	15	Asymmetry in the carbon cycle response to simultaneous CO 2 emissions and removals implies that a larger amount of CO 2 would need to be removed to compensate for an emission of a given magnitude to attain the same change in atmospheric CO 2	medium	1	train
272	AR6_WGI	115	16	CDR methods have wide-ranging side- effects that can either weaken or strengthen the carbon sequestration and cooling potential of these methods and affect the achievement of sustainable development goals	high	2	train
273	AR6_WGI	115	25	In the same way part of current anthropogenic net CO 2 emissions are taken up by land and ocean carbon stores, net CO 2 removal will be partially counteracted by CO 2 release from these stores, such that the amount of CO 2 sequestered by CDR will not result in an equivalent drop in atmospheric CO 2	very high	3	train
274	AR6_WGI	115	26	The fraction of CO 2 removed from the atmosphere that is not replaced by CO 2 released from carbon stores – a measure of CDR effectiveness – decreases slightly with increasing amounts of removal (medium confidence) and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower atmospheric CO 2 concentrations	medium	1	train
275	AR6_WGI	115	27	The reduction in global surface temperature is approximately linearly related to cumulative CO 2 removal	high	2	train
276	AR6_WGI	115	28	Because of this near-linear relationship, the amount of cooling per unit CO 2 removed is approximately independent of the rate and amount of removal	medium	1	train

285	AR6_WGI	117	9	The methodology for doing this has been placed on a more robust scientific footing compared to AR5	high	2	train
286	AR6_WGI	117	10	Methane from fossil fuel sources has slightly higher emissions metric values than those from biogenic sources since it leads to additional fossil CO 2 in the atmosphere	high	2	train
287	AR6_WGI	117	11	Updates to the chemical adjustments for CH 4 and N2O emissions (Section TS.3.1) and revisions in their lifetimes result in emissions metrics for GWP and GTP that are slightly lower than in AR5	medium	1	train
288	AR6_WGI	117	15	When GHGs are aggregated using standard metrics such as GWP or GTP, cumulative CO 2-e emissions are not necessarily proportional to future global surface temperature outcomes	high	2	train
289	AR6_WGI	117	19	The warming evolution resulting from net zero GHG emissions defined in this way corresponds approximately to reaching net zero CO 2 emissions, and would thus not lead to declining temperatures after net zero GHG emissions are achieved but to an approximate temperature stabilization	high	2	train
290	AR6_WGI	117	20	The choice of emissions metric hence affects the quantification of net zero GHG emissions, and therefore the resulting temperature outcome of reaching and sustaining net zero GHG emissions levels	high	2	train
291	AR6_WGI	117	29	Fossil fuel combustion for energy, industry and land transportation are the largest contributing sectors on a 100-year time scale	high	2	train
292	AR6_WGI	117	30	Current emissions of CO 2, N2O and SLCFs from East Asia and North America are the largest regional contributors to additional net future warming on both short (medium confidence) and long time scales (10 and 100 years, respectively)	high	2	train
293	AR6_WGI	118	2	However, these reductions were lower than what would be expected from sustained implementation of policies addressing air quality and climate change	medium	1	train
294	AR6_WGI	118	4	Consistent with this small net radiative forcing, and against a large component of internal variability, Earth system models show no detectable effect on global or regional surface temperature or precipitation	high	2	train
295	AR6_WGI	119	2	This additional warming is stable after 2040 in SSPs associated with lower global air pollution as long as CH 4 emissions are also mitigated, but the overall warming induced by SLCF changes is higher in scenarios in which air quality continues to deteriorate (induced by growing fossil fuel use and limited air pollution control)	high	2	train
296	AR6_WGI	119	3	Sustained CH 4 mitigation reduces global surface ozone, contributing to air quality improvements, and also reduces surface temperature in the longer term, but only sustained CO 2 emissions reductions allow long-term climate stabilization	high	2	train
297	AR6_WGI	119	4	Future changes in air quality (near-surface ozone and particulate matter, or PM) at global and local scales are predominantly driven by changes in ozone and aerosol precursor emissions rather than climate	high	2	train
298	AR6_WGI	119	5	Air quality improvements driven by rapid decarbonization strategies, as in SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, are not sufficient in the near term to achieve air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization in some highly polluted regions	high	2	train
299	AR6_WGI	119	20	Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, PM levels are projected to increase until 2050 over large parts of Asia, and surface ozone pollution is projected to worsen over all continental areas through 2100	high	2	train
300	AR6_WGI	119	21	In SSP5-8.5, a scenario without climate change mitigation but with stringent air pollution control, PM levels decline through 2100, but high CH 4 levels hamper the decline in global surface ozone at least until 2080	high	2	train

302	AR6_WGI	120	12	However, there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scales and seasonal time scales	high	2	train
303	AR6_WGI	120	13	The cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO 2 sinks (medium confidence), but this would not stop CO 2 from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions	high	2	train
304	AR6_WGI	120	15	A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO 2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change	high	2	train

306	AR6_WGI	121	10	Since AR5, more modelling work has been conducted with more sophisticated treatment of aerosol-based SRM approaches, but the uncertainties in cloud–aerosol–radiation interactions are still large	high	2	train
307	AR6_WGI	121	11	Modelling studies suggest that it is possible to stabilize multiple large-scale temperature indicators simultaneously by tailoring the deployment strategy of SRM options	medium	1	train
308	AR6_WGI	121	13	In contrast, cirrus cloud thinning, targeting longwave radiation, is expected to cause an increase in global mean precipitation	medium	1	train
309	AR6_WGI	121	14	If shortwave approaches are used to offset global mean warming, the magnitude of reduction in regional precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P–E) (Box TS.5), which is more relevant to freshwater availability, is smaller than precipitation decrease because of simultaneous reductions in both precipitation and evapotranspiration	medium	1	train
310	AR6_WGI	121	16	If SRM is used to cool the planet, it would cause a reduction in plant and soil respiration and slow the reduction of ocean carbon uptake due to warming	medium	1	train
311	AR6_WGI	121	17	The result would be an enhancement of the global land and ocean CO 2 sinks	medium	1	train
312	AR6_WGI	121	18	However, SRM would not stop CO 2 from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions	high	2	train
313	AR6_WGI	121	20	A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high GHG emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change and a reversal of the SRM effects on the carbon sinks	high	2	train

317	AR6_WGI	122	10	Some processes suspected of having tipping points, such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), have been found to often undergo recovery after temperature stabilization with a time delay	low	0	train
318	AR6_WGI	122	13	It is likely that under stabilization of global warming at 1.5°C, 2.0°C or 3.0°C relative to 1850–1900, the AMOC will continue to weaken for several decades by about 15%, 20% and 30% of its strength and then recover to pre-decline values over several centuries	medium	1	train
319	AR6_WGI	122	14	At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; both the probability of their complete loss and the rate of mass loss increases with higher surface temperatures	high	2	train
320	AR6_WGI	122	15	At sustained warming levels between 3°C and 5°C, near-complete loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet and complete loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to occur irreversibly over multiple millennia (medium confidence); with substantial parts or all of Wilkes Subglacial Basin in East Antarctica lost over multiple millennia	low	0	train
321	AR6_WGI	122	17	For other hazards (e.g., ice-sheet behaviour, glacier mass loss and global mean sea level change, coastal floods, coastal erosion, air pollution, and ocean acidification) the time and/or scenario dimensions remain critical, and a simple and robust relationship with global warming level cannot be established	high	2	train
322	AR6_WGI	122	19	For global warming up to 2°C above 1850–1900 levels, paleoclimate records do not indicate abrupt changes in the carbon cycle	low	0	test
323	AR6_WGI	122	20	Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO 2 by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than uncertainties related to carbon–climate feedbacks	high	2	train
324	AR6_WGI	122	22	The increase in global ocean heat content (Section TS.2.4) will likely continue until at least 2300 even for low emissions scenarios, and global mean sea level will continue to rise for centuries to millennia following cessation of emissions (Box TS.4) due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets	high	2	train
325	AR6_WGI	123	2	Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in biogeochemical cycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century atmospheric GHG concentrations, but future anthropogenic emissions remain the dominant uncertainty	high	2	train

329	AR6_WGI	123	20	Discarding models that fundamentally misrepresent relevant processes improves the credibility of regional climate information generated from these ensembles	high	2	train
330	AR6_WGI	123	21	However, multi-model mean and ensemble spread are not a full measure of the range of projection uncertainty and are not sufficient to characterize low-likelihood, high-impact changes (Box TS.3) or situations where different models simulate substantially different or even opposite changes	high	2	train

333	AR6_WGI	124	22	In some cases, even the sign of a projected change in regional climate cannot be trusted if relevant regional processes are not represented, for example, for variables such as precipitation and wind speed	medium	1	train
334	AR6_WGI	124	25	However, the performance of these techniques depends on that of the driving climate model: in particular, bias adjustment cannot overcome all consequences of unresolved or strongly misrepresented physical processes, such as large-scale circulation biases or local feedbacks	medium	1	train
335	AR6_WGI	126	18	Distilling regional climate information from multiple lines of evidence and taking the user context into account increases fitness, usefulness, relevance and trust in that information for use in climate services (Box TS.11) and decision-making	high	2	train

668	AR6_WGI	369	7	Given that GMSL change must be due to some combination of transient land ice growth and changes in terrestrial water storage, additional global mean thermosteric sea-level increase of 7 ± 2 m (Fischer et al., 2018) implies a peak EECO GMSL of 70–76 m	low	0	train

777	AR6_WGI	499	27	As reported in Section 2.3.3.4.1, estimates of AMOC since at least 1950, which are generated from observed surface temperatures or sea surface height, suggest the AMOC weakened through the 20th century	low	0	train
778	AR6_WGI	501	21	In summary, while there have been improvements across successive CMIP phases (from CMIP3 to CMIP6) in the representation of the Southern Ocean circulation, such that the mean zonal and overturning circulations of the Southern Ocean are now broadly reproduced, substantial observational uncertainty and climate model challenges preclude attribution of Southern Ocean circulation changes	high	2	train

782	AR6_WGI	505	6	Section 5.2.1.3 assesses that both observational reconstructions based on the partial pressure of CO 2 and ocean biogeochemical models show a quasi-linear increase in the ocean sink of anthropogenic CO 2 from 1.0 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1 to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 between 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO 2 emissions	high	2	train

785	AR6_WGI	510	24	While ozone depletion contributed to the trend from the 1970s to the 1990s (medium confidence), its influence has been small since 2000, leading to a weaker summertime SAM trend over 2000–2019	medium	1	train

791	AR6_WGI	517	1	Nevertheless, CMIP5 models have medium overall performance in reproducing both the interannual IOB and IOD modes, with an apparently good performance in reproducing the IOB magnitude arising from compensation of biases in the formation process, and overly high IOD magnitude due to the mean state bias	high	2	train
792	AR6_WGI	520	3	As such, PDV is an important driver of decadal internal climate variability which limits detection of human influence on various aspects of decadal climate change on global to regional scales	high	2	train

794	AR6_WGI	522	5	In particular, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols are thought to have played a role in the timing and intensity of the negative (cold) phase of AMV recorded from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s and subsequent warming	medium	1	train
795	AR6_WGI	522	23	The pattern of ocean salinity changes indicate that fresh regions are becoming fresher and that salty regions are becoming saltier as a result of changes in ocean-atmosphere fluxes through evaporation and precipitation	high	2	test
796	AR6_WGI	526	1	Earth System models characterized by additional biogeochemical feedbacks often perform at least as well as related more constrained, lower-complexity models lacking these feedbacks	medium	1	train

798	AR6_WGI	526	3	Moreover, synthesizing across Sections 3.3–3.7, we assess that the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well	high	2	train
799	AR6_WGI	528	27	Overall, the PMIP multi-model means agree very well (within 0.5°C of the assessed range) with GSAT reconstructed from proxies across multiple time periods, spanning a range from 6°C colder than pre-industrial (Last Glacial Maximum) to 14°C warmer than pre-industrial (Early Eocene Climate Optimum)	high	2	train
800	AR6_WGI	528	28	During the orbitally-forced mid-Holocene, the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures the sign of the regional changes in temperature and precipitation in most regions assessed, and there have been some regional improvements compared to AR5	medium	1	train
801	AR6_WGI	528	29	The limited number of CMIP6 simulations of the LGM hinders model evaluation of the multi-model mean, but for both LGM and mid-Holocene, models tend to underestimate the magnitude of large changes	high	2	train
802	AR6_WGI	528	30	Some long-standing model-data discrepancies, such as a dry bias in North Africa in the mid-Holocene, have not improved in CMIP6 compared with PMIP3	high	2	train
803	AR6_WGI	530	7	In comparison with standard resolution CMIP6 models, higher resolution probed under the HighResMIP activity (Haarsma et al., 2016) improves aspects of the simulation of climate (particularly concerning sea surface temperature) but discrepancies remain and there are some regions, such as parts of the Southern Ocean, where currently attainable resolution produces inferior performance	high	2	train
804	AR6_WGI	571	16	The other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was assessed as ‘current’ in SR1.5	medium	1	train
805	AR6_WGI	571	19	If climate sensitivity lies near the lower end of the assessed very likely range, crossing the 1.5°C warming threshold is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6	medium	1	train

811	AR6_WGI	571	31	For SSP5-8.5, higher climate sensitivity is the primary reason behind the upper end of the warming being higher than in CMIP5	medium	1	train
812	AR6_WGI	571	33	For SSP1-2.6, such a high-warming storyline implies long-term (2081–2100) warming well above, rather than well below, 2°C	high	2	train
813	AR6_WGI	571	34	Irrespective of scenario, high-warming storylines imply changes in many aspects of the climate system that exceed the patterns associated with the central estimate of GSAT changes by up to more than 50%	high	2	train
814	AR6_WGI	572	2	The warming pattern likely varies across seasons, with northern high latitudes warming more during boreal winter than summer	medium	1	train

819	AR6_WGI	572	18	In the long term (2081–2100), monsoon rainfall change will feature a north–south asymmetry characterized by a greater increase in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere and an east–west asymmetry characterized by an increase in Asian-African monsoon regions and a decrease in the North American monsoon region	medium	1	train
820	AR6_WGI	572	19	Near-term changes in global monsoon precipitation and circulation are uncertain due to model uncertainty and internal variability such as Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability and Pacific Decadal Variability	medium	1	train

825	AR6_WGI	573	10	Arctic sea ice area in March, the month of annual maximum sea ice area, also decreases in the future under each of the considered scenarios, but to a much lesser degree (in percentage terms) than in September	high	2	train
826	AR6_WGI	573	12	For the period 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014, GMSL is likely to rise by 0.46–0.74 m under SSP3-7.0 and by 0.30–0.54 m under SSP1-2.6	medium	1	train
827	AR6_WGI	573	17	The fraction of emissions absorbed by land and ocean sinks will be smaller under high emissions scenarios than under low emissions scenarios	high	2	train
828	AR6_WGI	573	18	Ocean surface pH will decrease steadily through the 21st century, except for SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 where values decrease until around 2070 and then increase slightly to 2100	high	2	train
829	AR6_WGI	573	20	However, the response of many other climate quantities to mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, especially on the regional scale	high	2	train
830	AR6_WGI	573	21	The mitigation benefits for these quantities would emerge only later during the 21st century	high	2	train
831	AR6_WGI	573	22	During the near term, a small fraction of the surface can show cooling under all scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is fully consistent with GSAT increase	high	2	train
832	AR6_WGI	573	23	Events of reduced and increased GSAT trends at decadal time scales will continue to occur in the 21st century but will not affect the centennial warming	very high	3	train
833	AR6_WGI	573	27	The climate effect of a sudden and sustained CDR termination would depend on the amount of CDR-induced cooling prior to termination and the rate of background CO 2 emissions at the time of termination	high	2	train
834	AR6_WGI	573	31	A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high-emissions scenario such as SSP5-8.5 would cause a rapid climate change	high	2	train
835	AR6_WGI	574	2	Overshooting specific global warming levels such as 2°C has effects on the climate system that persist beyond 2100	medium	1	train
836	AR6_WGI	574	3	Under one scenario including a peak and decline in atmospheric CO 2 concentration (SSP5-3.4-OS), some climate metrics such as GSAT begin to decline but do not fully reverse by 2100 to levels prior to the CO 2 peak	medium	1	train
837	AR6_WGI	574	9	GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (likely 6.6°C–14.1°C higher than over the period 1850–1900) overlaps with the range estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum (5°C–10°C higher) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (10°C–18°C higher), about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively	medium	1	train
838	AR6_WGI	584	25	The warming has increased in part because of models with higher ECS in CMIP6, compared to CMIP5	high	2	train
839	AR6_WGI	587	3	The AR5 further assessed that GSAT averaged over the period 2081–2100 are projected to likely exceed 1.5°C above 1850–1900 for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence) and are likely to exceed 2°C above 1850–1900 for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5	high	2	train
840	AR6_WGI	587	4	Global surface temperature changes above 2°C under RCP2.6 were deemed unlikely	medium	1	train
841	AR6_WGI	588	4	In summary, the CMIP6 models show a general tendency toward larger long-term globally averaged surface warming than did the CMIP5 models, for nominally comparable scenarios	very high	3	train
842	AR6_WGI	588	5	In SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, the 5–95% ranges have remained similar to the ranges in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, respectively, but the distributions have shifted upward by about 0.3°C	high	2	train
843	AR6_WGI	588	6	For SSP5-8.5 compared to RCP8.5, the 5% bound of the distribution has hardly changed, but the 95% bound and the range have increased by about 20% and 40%, respectively	high	2	train
844	AR6_WGI	588	22	This means that the CMIP6 spread in GSAT response to CO 2 emissions is dominated by climate sensitivity differences between ESMs more than by carbon cycle differences	high	2	train
845	AR6_WGI	589	4	These differences due to experimental configuration would be smaller still under scenarios with lower CO 2 levels, and so we assess that results from concentration-driven and emissions- driven configurations do not affect the assessment of GSAT projections	high	2	train
846	AR6_WGI	589	8	Based on these results, we conclude that global land precipitation is larger during the period 2081–2100 than during the period 1995–2014, under all scenarios considered here	high	2	train
847	AR6_WGI	590	4	There is no change in subtropical precipitation in the North Atlantic following SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, or SSP2-4.5	high	2	train
848	AR6_WGI	590	6	These range from 43% under RCP2.6 and 94% under RCP8.5 in September, and from 8% under RCP2.6 and 34% under RCP8.5 in March	medium	1	train
849	AR6_WGI	591	3	Based on results from the CMIP6 models, we conclude that on average the Arctic will become practically ice-free in September by the end of the 21st century under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5	high	2	train
850	AR6_WGI	591	4	Also, in the CMIP6 models, Arctic SIA in March decreases in the future, but to a much lesser degree, in percentage terms, than in September	high	2	train
851	AR6_WGI	591	11	The individual model simulations, for which there are twenty for each stabilized temperature level, show that the probability of the Arctic becoming practically ice free at the end of the 21st century is significantly higher for 2°C warming than for 1.5°C warming above 1850–1900 levels	high	2	train
852	AR6_WGI	591	13	Further, AR5 concluded that for the period 2081–2100, compared to 1986–2005, GMSL rise is likely	medium	1	train
853	AR6_WGI	592	11	In summary, we assess from the CMIP6 models that AMOC weakening over the 21st century is very likely ; the rate of weakening is approximately independent of the emissions scenario	high	2	train
854	AR6_WGI	592	15	In summary, in these model simulations the AMOC recovers over several centuries after the cessation of CO 2 emissions	medium	1	train
855	AR6_WGI	593	3	We assess that the cumulative uptake of carbon by the ocean and by land will increase through the 21st century irrespective of the considered emissions scenarios except SSP1-1.9	very high	3	test
856	AR6_WGI	593	6	Based on results from the CMIP6 models we conclude that, except for the lower-emissions scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, ocean surface pH decreases monotonically through the 21st century	high	2	train
857	AR6_WGI	594	7	Strong positive trends for the NAM/NAO indices were observed since 1960, which have weakened since the 1990s	high	2	train
858	AR6_WGI	594	13	Based on CMIP6 model results displayed in Figure 4.9a, we conclude that the boreal wintertime surface NAM is more positive by the end of the 21st century under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5	high	2	train
859	AR6_WGI	594	15	On the other hand, under neither of the lowest emissions scenarios, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, does the NAM show a robust change, by the end of the 21st century	high	2	train
860	AR6_WGI	595	12	Over the instrumental period, there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM index, particularly since 1970	high	2	train
861	AR6_WGI	595	22	In summary, under the highest emissions scenarios in the CMIP6 models, the SAM in the austral summer becomes more positive through the 21st century	high	2	train
862	AR6_WGI	596	14	Over the mid-term period 2041–2060, the very likely GSAT ranges of SSP1-1.9 and SSP5-8.5 are almost completely distinct	high	2	train
863	AR6_WGI	596	15	CMIP6 models project a wider range of GSAT change than the assessed range	high	2	train
864	AR6_WGI	598	10	Roughly half of this difference arises from a larger historical warming diagnosed in AR6, while the other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was estimated as ‘current’ in SR1.5	medium	1	train
865	AR6_WGI	598	14	If ECS and TCR lie near the lower end of the assessed very likely range, crossing the 1.5°C warming threshold is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6	medium	1	train
866	AR6_WGI	599	5	The AR5 further assessed that it is more likely than not that the mean GSAT for the period 2016–2035 will be more than 1°C above the mean for 1850–1900, and it is very unlikely that it will be more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean	medium	1	train
867	AR6_WGI	599	8	Averaged over the twenty years of the near term and across all scenarios, GSAT is very likely to be higher than over 1995–2014 by 0.4°C–1.0°C (Table 4.5), with most of the uncertainty arising from that in ECS and TCR	high	2	train
868	AR6_WGI	599	13	For annual mean GSAT, uncertainty in near-term projections arises in roughly equal measure from internal variability and model uncertainty	high	2	train
869	AR6_WGI	599	14	Forecasts initialized from recent observations simulate GSAT changes for the period 2019–2028 relative to the recent past that are consistent with the assessed very likely range in annual mean GSAT	high	2	train
870	AR6_WGI	599	19	By 2030, GSAT in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a likelihood between 40 and 60 percent, across the scenarios considered here	medium	1	train
871	AR6_WGI	601	9	Near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain mainly because of natural internal variability, model uncertainty, and uncertainty in natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcing	medium	1	train
872	AR6_WGI	602	7	In summary, we assess that near-term changes in global monsoon precipitation and circulation will be affected by the combined effects of model uncertainty and internal variability, such as AMV and PDV, which together are larger than the forced signal	medium	1	train
873	AR6_WGI	603	1	Based on results from CMIP6 models, we conclude that SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 all clearly lead to increasing 10-, 20-, and 30-year trends in ocean carbon flux over the near term	high	2	train
874	AR6_WGI	604	5	Considering these new results since AR5, in the near-term it is likely that any anthropogenic forced signal in the NAM will be of comparable magnitude or smaller than natural internal variability in the NAM	medium	1	train
875	AR6_WGI	605	12	Hence, no robust change in amplitude of ENSO SST and rainfall variability is expected in the near term although the rainfall variability slightly increases	medium	1	train
876	AR6_WGI	606	1	However, some studies show that despite severe model biases there are skilful predictions in the mean state of tropical Atlantic surface temperature several years ahead	medium	1	train
877	AR6_WGI	607	11	The AR5 assessed that emission reductions aimed at decreasing local air pollution could have a near-term warming impact on climate	high	2	train
878	AR6_WGI	608	15	Volcanic eruptions generally result in decreased global precipitation for up to a few years following the eruption (Iles and Hegerl, 2014, 2015; Man et al., 2014), with climatologically wet regions drying and climatologically dry regions wetting	medium	1	train
879	AR6_WGI	608	22	In these simulations with multiple volcanic forcing futures there is: (i) an increase in the frequency of extremely cold individual years; (ii) an increased likelihood of decades with negative GSAT trend (decades with negative GSAT trends become 50% more commonplace); (iii) later anthropogenic signal emergence (the mean time at which the signal of global warming emerges from the noise of natural climate variability is delayed almost everywhere)	high	2	train
880	AR6_WGI	609	20	Yet, remaining disagreements reflect differences in the volcanic forcing datasets used in the simulations	medium	1	train
881	AR6_WGI	612	8	The ratio of land-to-ocean warming is greater than one for almost all regions	high	2	train
882	AR6_WGI	612	22	Projected reduction in the strength of the AMOC over the 21st century is expected to reduce Arctic warming, but even a strong AMOC reduction would not eliminate Arctic amplification entirely	medium	1	train
883	AR6_WGI	614	2	There is growing evidence that year-to-year and day-to-day temperature variability decreases in winter over northern mid- to high-latitudes (Fischer et al., 2011; De Vries et al., 2012; Screen, 2014; Schneider et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2016; Borodina et al., 2017; Tamarin-Brodsky et al., 2020) which implies that the lowest temperatures rise more than the respective climatological mean temperatures	medium	1	train
884	AR6_WGI	617	32	Consistent with the AR5, patterns of precipitation change are very likely to increase in the high latitudes especially during local winter and over tropical oceans under SSP3-7.0	high	2	train

891	AR6_WGI	624	13	The projected large-scale surface ocean acidification will be primarily determined by the pathway of atmospheric CO 2, with weak dependence on change in climate	high	2	train
892	AR6_WGI	624	14	However, for a given atmospheric CO 2 scenario, uncertainty in projected ocean acidification increases with ocean depth because of model-simulated differences in ocean circulation that transports anthropogenic CO 2 from the surface to bottom ocean	high	2	train

976	AR6_WGI	739	27	Recent studies (Katavouta et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020) suggest with medium confidence that the decrease in the ocean CO 2 uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, under low to no mitigation scenarios over the 21st century, is predominantly attributable to the ocean carbon- concentration feedback through the reduction of the seawater CO 2 buffering capacity, but with contributions from physical drivers such as warming and wind stress (medium confidence) and biological drivers	low	0	train
977	AR6_WGI	740	3	Overall, there is medium confidence on three outcomes in the ocean from projected CO 2 uptake under medium to high CO 2 concentration scenarios: (i) a weakening of the buffering capacity, which impacts the airborne fraction via the reduction of the ocean CO 2 buffering capacity due to cumulative ocean CO 2 uptake, which reduces the net ocean CO 2 uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (Katavouta et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020); (ii) an amplification of the seasonal cycle of CO 2 variables, which impacts both the ocean sink and ocean acidification (Hauck et al., 2015); (iii) a decrease in the aragonite and calcite saturation levels in the ocean, which negatively impacts the calcification rates of marine organisms	high	2	train

985	AR6_WGI	749	19	In summary, oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO 2, but the fraction of emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO 2 concentration increases	high	2	train
986	AR6_WGI	749	22	Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO 2 by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than carbon–climate feedbacks	high	2	train

1144	AR6_WGI	942	3	The 0.59 W m–2 increase in ERF from greenhouse gases is partly offset by a better-constrained assessment of total aerosol ERF that is more strongly negative than in AR5, based on multiple lines of evidence	high	2	train
1145	AR6_WGI	942	4	Changes in surface reflectance from land-use change, deposition of light-absorbing particles on ice and snow, and contrails and aviation-induced cirrus have also contributed to the total anthropogenic ERF over the industrial era, with –0.20 [–0.30 to –0.10] W m–2 (medium confidence), +0.08 [0 to 0.18] W m–2 (low confidence) and +0.06 [0.02 to 0.10] W m–2	low	0	train

1148	AR6_WGI	942	17	It is also assessed to be smaller in magnitude at –1.1 [–1.7 to –0.4] W m–2, primarily due to recent emissions changes	medium	1	train
1149	AR6_WGI	942	22	A net negative cloud feedback is very unlikely	high	2	train
1150	AR6_WGI	942	27	Furthermore, on long time scales the ice-sheet feedback parameter is very likely positive, promoting additional warming on millennial time scales as ice sheets come into equilibrium with the forcing	high	2	train

1153	AR6_WGI	943	7	These higher ECS and TCR values can, in some models, be traced to changes in extra-tropical cloud feedbacks that have emerged from efforts to reduce biases in these clouds compared to satellite observations	medium	1	train
1154	AR6_WGI	943	11	The CMIP models with the highest ECS and TCR values provide insights into low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes, which cannot be excluded based on currently available evidence	high	2	train
1155	AR6_WGI	943	14	The calculated GSAT change is composed of a well-mixed greenhouse gas warming of 1.58 [1.17 to 2.17] °C (high confidence), a warming from ozone changes of 0.23 [0.11 to 0.39] °C (high confidence), a cooling of –0.50 [–0.22 to –0.96] °C from aerosol effects (medium confidence), and a –0.06 [–0.15 to +0.01] °C contribution from surface reflectance changes from land-use change and light-absorbing particles on ice and snow	medium	1	train
1156	AR6_WGI	943	15	Changes in solar and volcanic activity are assessed to have together contributed a small change of –0.02 [–0.06 to +0.02] °C since 1750	medium	1	train

1161	AR6_WGI	943	31	Metrics for methane from fossil fuel sources account for the extra fossil CO 2 that these emissions contribute to the atmosphere and so have slightly higher emissions metric values than those from biogenic sources	high	2	train
1162	AR6_WGI	944	1	By contrast, if emissions are weighted by their 100-year GWP or GTP values, different multi-gas emissions pathways with the same aggregated CO 2 equivalent emissions rarely lead to the same estimated temperature outcome	high	2	train
1163	AR6_WGI	944	5	In contrast, reaching net zero GHG emissions when quantified using new emissions metrics such as CGTP or GWP* would lead to approximate temperature stabilization	high	2	train
1164	AR6_WGI	951	31	In summary, since AR5, the magnitudes of the global mean energy budget components have been quantified more accurately, not only at the TOA, but also at the Earth’s surface, where independent estimates of the radiative components have converged	high	2	train
1165	AR6_WGI	953	4	In summary, variations in the energy exchange between Earth and space can be accurately tracked since the advent of improved observations since the year 2000 (high confidence), while reconstructions indicate that the Earth’s energy imbalance was larger in the 2000s than in the 1985–1999 period	high	2	train
1166	AR6_WGI	953	34	The assessed changes in the global energy inventory (Box 7.2, Figure 1, and Table 7.1) yields an average value for Earth’s energy imbalance (N in Box 7.1, Equation 7.1) of 0.57 [0.43 to 0.72] W m–2 for the period 1971–2018, expressed relative to Earth’s surface area	high	2	train
1167	AR6_WGI	953	35	The estimates for the periods 1993–2018 and 2006–2018 yield substantially larger values of 0.72 [0.55 to 0.89] W m–2 and 0.79 [0.52 to 1.06] W m–2, respectively, consistent with the increased radiative forcing from GHGs	high	2	train
1168	AR6_WGI	954	1	To put these numbers in context, the 2006–2018 average Earth system heating is equivalent to approximately 20 times the annual rate of global energy consumption in 2018.1 Consistent with AR5 (Rhein et al., 2013), this Report finds that ocean warming dominates the changes in the global energy inventory	high	2	train
1169	AR6_WGI	954	2	The contributions from the other components across all periods are approximately 5% from land heating, 3% for cryosphere heating and 1% associated with warming of the atmosphere	high	2	train
1170	AR6_WGI	955	23	The origin of these trends is not fully understood, although there is evidence that anthropogenic aerosols have made a substantial contribution	medium	1	train
1171	AR6_WGI	957	4	For the period 1970–2011, AR5 reported that the global energy budget was closed within uncertainties	high	2	train
1172	AR6_WGI	961	10	The physiological adjustments are therefore assessed to make a substantial contribution to the overall tropospheric adjustment for CO 2	high	2	train
1173	AR6_WGI	961	15	Due to the agreement between the studies and the understanding of the physical mechanisms there is medium confidence in the mechanisms underpinning the tropospheric adjustment, but low confidence in its magnitude.The ERF from doubling CO 2 (2×CO 2) from the 1750 level (278 ppm; Section 2.2.3.3) is assessed to be 3.93 ± 0.47 W m–2	high	2	train
1174	AR6_WGI	963	9	This does not correspond to the division between ozone production and ozone depletion and is sensitive to the choice of tropopause	high	2	train
1175	AR6_WGI	963	11	This small positive (but with uncertainty encompassing negative values) stratospheric ozone SARF is due to contributions from ozone precursors to lower stratospheric ozone and some of the CMIP6 models showing ozone depletion in the upper stratosphere, where depletion contributes a positive radiative forcing	medium	1	train
1176	AR6_WGI	963	12	As there is insufficient evidence to quantify adjustments, for total ozone the assessed central estimate for ERF is assumed to be equal to SARF	low	0	train
1177	AR6_WGI	963	32	It has increased by 0.49 W m–2 compared to AR5 (reference year 2011)	high	2	train
1178	AR6_WGI	963	34	Changes in the radiative efficiencies (including adjustments) of CO 2, CH 4, N 2O and halogenated compounds have increased the ERF by an additional 0.15 W m–2 compared to the AR5 values	high	2	train
1179	AR6_WGI	963	38	The combined ERF from ozone and stratospheric water vapour has increased since AR5 by 0.10 ± 0.50 W m–2	high	2	train
1180	AR6_WGI	966	22	Based on the above, IRFari is assessed to be –0.25 ± 0.2 W m–2	medium	1	train
1181	AR6_WGI	966	24	Adding this small adjustment to our assessed IRFari estimate of –0.25 W m–2, and accounting for additional uncertainty in the adjustments, ERFari is assessed to –0.3 ± 0.3	medium	1	train
1182	AR6_WGI	968	27	Taking the average across the studies providing IRFaci estimates discussed above and considering the general agreement among estimates (Table 7.7), IRFaci is assessed to be –0.7 ± 0.5 W m–2	medium	1	train
1183	AR6_WGI	969	9	These three studies together suggest a global Cf adjustment that augments ERFaci relative to IRFaci by –0.5 ± 0.4 W m–2	medium	1	train
1184	AR6_WGI	969	18	Combining IRFaci and the associated adjustments in Cf and LWP (adding uncertainties in quadrature), considering only liquid-water clouds and evidence from satellite observations alone, the central estimate and very likely range for ERFaci is assessed to be –1.0 ± 0.7 W m–2	medium	1	train
1185	AR6_WGI	969	37	There is thus limited evidence and medium agreement for a small negative contribution to ERFaci from anthropogenic INP-induced cirrus modifications	low	0	test
1186	AR6_WGI	969	41	From model-based evidence, ERFaci is assessed to –1.0 ± 0.8 W m–2	medium	1	train
1187	AR6_WGI	970	1	The strong agreement between the two largely independent lines of evidence increases confidence in the overall assessment of the central estimate and very likely range for ERFaci of –1.0 ± 0.7 W m–2	medium	1	train
1188	AR6_WGI	970	38	Based solely on energy balance considerations or other observational constraints, it is extremely likely that the total aerosol ERF is negative (high confidence), but extremely unlikely that the total aerosol ERF is more negative than –2.0 W m–2	high	2	train
1189	AR6_WGI	971	18	Combining the lines of evidence and adding uncertainties in quadrature, the ERFari+aci estimated for 2014 relative to 1750 is assessed to be –1.3 [–2.0 to –0.6] W m–2	medium	1	train
1190	AR6_WGI	971	26	However, based on a general reduction in global mean AOD over this period (Section 2.2.6 and Figure 2.9), combined with a reduction in emissions of aerosols and their precursors in updated emissions inventories (Hoesly et al., 2018), the aerosol ERF is assessed to have decreased in magnitude from about 2014 to 2019	medium	1	train
1191	AR6_WGI	971	28	Aerosols are therefore assessed to have contributed an ERF of –1.1 [–1.7 to –0.4] W m–2 over 1750–2019	medium	1	train
1192	AR6_WGI	972	35	Adding the irrigation effect to this gives an overall assessment of the ERF from land-use change of –0.20 ± 0.10 W m–2	medium	1	train

1199	AR6_WGI	976	4	However, the total aerosol ERF is assessed to be more negative compared to AR5, due to revised estimates rather than trends	high	2	train

1203	AR6_WGI	978	4	Nonetheless, simple physically basedof a WMGHG warming of 1.58 [1.17 to 2.17] °C (high confidence), a warming from ozone changes of 0.23 [0.11 to 0.39] °C (high confidence), and a cooling of –0.50 [–0.22 to –0.96] °C from aerosol effects	medium	1	train
1204	AR6_WGI	978	6	There is also a –0.06 [–0.15 to +0.01] °C contribution from surface reflectance changes which is dominated by land-use change	medium	1	train
1205	AR6_WGI	978	7	Changes in solar and volcanic activity are assessed to have together contributed a small change of –0.02 [–0.06 to +0.02] °C since 1750	medium	1	train
1206	AR6_WGI	978	17	However, since 1980 the aerosol cooling trend has stabilized and may have started to reverse, so that over the last few decades the long-term warming has been occurring at a faster rate than would be expected due to CO 2 alone	high	2	train
1207	AR6_WGI	992	15	Since AR5, several studies have confirmed that a shift from tundra to boreal forests and the associated albedo change leads to increased warming in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes	high	2	train
1208	AR6_WGI	992	24	Given the limited number of studies, we take the full range of estimates discussed above for the biogeophysical feedback parameter, and assess the very likely range to be from 0.0 to +0.3 W m–2 °C–1, with a central estimate of +0.15 W m–2 °C–1	low	0	train
1209	AR6_WGI	993	25	As such, overall, on multi- centennial time scales the feedback parameter associated with ice sheets is likely negative (medium confidence), but on multi-millennial time scales by the time the ice sheets reach equilibrium, the feedback parameter is very likely positive	high	2	train
1210	AR6_WGI	1003	13	For both the MPWP and EECO, models are more consistent with the temperature and CO 2 proxies than at the time of AR5	high	2	train
1211	AR6_WGI	1003	14	For the LGM Northern Hemisphere, which is the region with the most data and the time period with the least uncertainty in model boundary conditions, polar amplification in the PMIP4 ensemble mean is in good agreement with the proxies, especially for SAT	medium	1	train
1212	AR6_WGI	1003	18	It is very likely that the warming in the Arctic will be more pronounced than the global average over the 21st century	high	2	train
1213	AR6_WGI	1003	19	This is supported by models’ improved ability to simulate polar amplification during past time periods, compared with at the time of AR5	high	2	train
1214	AR6_WGI	1008	7	The value of α’ is larger if quantified based on the observed pattern of warming since 1980 (Figure 2.11b) which is more distinct from the equilibrium warming pattern expected under CO 2 forcing	high	2	train
1215	AR6_WGI	1011	3	In summary, the process-based estimate of TCR is assessed to have the central value of 2.0°C with the likely range from 1.6 to 2.7 °C and the very likely range from 1.3 to 3.1 °C	high	2	train
1216	AR6_WGI	1014	33	Regression-based feedbacks thus provide estimates of the radiative feedbacks that are associated with internal climate variability (e.g., Brown et al., 2014), and do not provide a direct estimate of ECS	high	2	train
1217	AR6_WGI	1015	8	Estimates based on the response to volcanic eruptions agree with other lines of evidence (Knutti et al., 2017), but they do not constitute a direct estimate of ECS	high	2	train
1218	AR6_WGI	1015	11	However, there is robust evidence and high agreement across the lines of evidence that ECS is extremely likely greater than 1.6°C	high	2	train
1219	AR6_WGI	1015	12	There is robust evidence and medium agreement across the lines of evidence that ECS is very likely greater than 1.8°C and likely greater than 2.2°C	high	2	train
1220	AR6_WGI	1015	13	These ranges of ECS correspond to estimates based on historical global energy budget constraints (Section 7.5.2.1) under the assumption of no feedback dependence on evolving SST patterns (i.e., α’ = 0) and thus represent an underestimate of the true ECS ranges that can be inferred from this line of evidence	high	2	train
1221	AR6_WGI	1015	15	Global energy budget constraints indicate a central estimate (median) TCR value of 1.9°C and that TCR is likely in the range 1.5 to 2.3 °C and very likely in the range 1.3 to 2.7 °C	high	2	train
1222	AR6_WGI	1018	1	As such, based solely on the paleoclimate record, it is assessed to be very likely that ECS is greater than 1.5°C	high	2	train
1223	AR6_WGI	1019	2	Despite the large variation in individual studies at the extreme upper end, all except two studies (both of which are from glacial–interglacial time periods associated with low confidence) have central estimates that are below 6°C; overall we assess that it is extremely likely that ECS is below 8°C	high	2	train
1224	AR6_WGI	1025	3	The high ECS and TCR values can in some CMIP6 models be traced to improved representation of extratropical cloud feedbacks	medium	1	train
1225	AR6_WGI	1025	5	Solely based on its ECS or TCR values an individual ESM cannot be ruled out as implausible, though some models with high (greater than 5°C) and low (less than 2°C) ECS are less consistent with past climate change	high	2	train
1226	AR6_WGI	1027	30	Global ocean heat uptake is a smaller source of uncertainty in long-term surface warming	high	2	train
1227	AR6_WGI	1030	22	In summary, GWPs and GTPs for methane and nitrous oxide are slightly lower than in AR5	medium	1	train
1228	AR6_WGI	1030	29	Estimates of the yield are 61% (Boucher et al., 2009) and 88% (Shindell et al., 2017), so the assessed range is 50–100% with a central value of 75%	low	0	train
1229	AR6_WGI	1030	34	Methane from fossil fuel sources has therefore slightly higher emissions metric values than those from biogenic sources	high	2	train
1230	AR6_WGI	1035	10	Hence, net zero CO 2 and net zero GHG, quantified using these new approaches, would both lead to approximately stable contributions to temperature change after net zero emissions are achieved	high	2	train

1233	AR6_WGI	1073	11	An increase in near-surface atmospheric water holding capacity of about 7% per 1°C of warming explains a similar magnitude of intensification of heavy precipitation events (from sub-daily up to seasonal time scales) that increases the severity of flood hazards when these extremes occur	high	2	train

1240	AR6_WGI	1073	24	Cooling in the Northern Hemisphere by sulphate aerosols explained a southward shift in the tropical rain belt and contributed to the Sahel drought from the 1970s to the 1980s (high confidence), subsequent recovery from which has been linked with greenhouse gas warming	medium	1	train
1241	AR6_WGI	1073	25	Observed changes in regional monsoon precipitation, especially over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa, have been limited over much of the 20th century due to increases driven by warming from greenhouse gases being counteracted by decreases due to cooling from anthropogenic aerosols	high	2	train

1434	AR6_WGI	1241	7	In summary, globally integrated and large-scale fluxes are more reliably inferred from heat content and salinity change, while regional trends are rarely robust in observations; where they are robust, they tend to be underestimated or in disagreement in models	very high	3	train

1443	AR6_WGI	1247	4	In summary, and strengthening SROCC assessment, ocean warming is not globally uniform due to patterns of uptake predominantly along known water mass pathways, and due to changing ocean circulation redistributing heat within the ocean	high	2	train

1447	AR6_WGI	1249	2	In summary, on decadal time scales, redistribution will dominate regional patterns of OHC change without affecting the globally integrated OHC; however, by 2100, particularly under strong warming scenarios, there is high confidence that regional patterns of OHC change will be dominated by added heat entering the sea surface, primarily in water mass formation regions in the subtropics; and reduced aerosols will increase the relative rate of Northern Hemisphere heat uptake	medium	1	train

1453	AR6_WGI	1253	18	The SROCC (Collins et al., 2019) assessed that in situ observations (2004–2017) and sea surface temperature reconstructions indicate that AMOC has weakened relative to 1850–1900	medium	1	train
1454	AR6_WGI	1254	10	This suggests that the observed AMOC-shift between 2007 and 2011 may be part of a longer-term decrease	medium	1	train

1461	AR6_WGI	1257	23	Section 2.3.3.4 assesses that, while WBC strength is highly variable at multi-decadal scale (high confidence), WBCs and subtropical gyres have shifted poleward since 1993	medium	1	train
1462	AR6_WGI	1258	3	In the North Pacific, there has been an increasing trend in the Alaska Gyre from 1993 to 2017 (Cummins and Masson, 2018), which might be attributed to Pacific Decadal Oscillation	low	0	train
1463	AR6_WGI	1258	5	All climate models reproduce WBCs and gyres, but eddy- present or eddy-rich models (roughly 10–25 km and about 10 km resolution, respectively) represent these currents more realistically than eddy-parameterized models	very high	3	train
1464	AR6_WGI	1258	7	Increased resolution admits mesoscale eddies, and also improves simulation of the strength and position of WBCs such as the Kuroshio Current, Gulf Stream, and East Australian Current	very high	3	train

1466	AR6_WGI	1258	10	As eddies potentially play a role in determining the strength of gyre circulations and their low- frequency variability (Fox-Kemper and Pedlosky, 2004; Berloff et al., 2007), it is expected that eddy-present and eddy-rich models will differ in their decadal variability and sensitivity to changes in the wind stress of gyres from eddy-parameterized models	medium	1	test

1491	AR6_WGI	1269	14	Paleo-proxy data indicate that, on multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales, sea ice coverage of the Southern Ocean follows large-scale temperature trends (e.g., Crosta et al., 2018; Chadwick et al., 2020; Lamping et al., 2020), for example linked to fluctuations in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode (Crosta et al., 2021), and that during the Last Glacial Maximum, Antarctic sea ice extended to about the polar front latitude in most regions during winter, whereas the extent during summer is less well understood (e.g., Benz et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016; Nair et al., 2019).Regionally, proxy data from ice cores consistently indicate that the increase of sea ice area in the Ross Sea and the decrease of sea ice area in the Bellingshausen Sea are part of longer centennial trends and exceed internal variability on multi-decadal time scales	medium	1	train

1505	AR6_WGI	1285	32	Grounding line stabilization by the solid Earth response may therefore occur over the 21st century in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, where most mass loss is occurring (Section 9.4.2.1), but more generally occurs over multi-centennial to millennial time scales	medium	1	train
1506	AR6_WGI	1288	12	In summary, it is likely that the AIS will continue to lose mass throughout this century under all emissions scenarios – that is, dynamic losses driven by ocean warming and ice-shelf disintegration will likely continue to outpace increasing snowfall	medium	1	train

1508	AR6_WGI	1289	9	Overall, increased evidence and agreement on the time scales and drivers of mass loss confirm the SR1.5 assessment that a threshold for WAIS instability may be close to 1.5°C–2°C (medium confidence), and that the probability of passing a threshold is larger for 2°C warming than for 1.5°C	medium	1	train
1509	AR6_WGI	1289	10	New projections agree with previous studies that only part of WAIS would be lost on multi-century time scales if warming remains less than 2°C	medium	1	train
1510	AR6_WGI	1289	12	Under around 2°C–3°C peak warming, complete or near-complete loss of the WAIS is projected in most studies after multiple millennia, with continent-wide mass losses of around 2–5 m SLE or more; this could occur on multi-century time scales under very high basal melting (Lipscomb et al., 2021) or widespread ice-shelf loss and/or MICI	low	0	test

1513	AR6_WGI	1289	22	New research therefore confirms SROCC assessment that mass loss from the AIS is irreversible on decadal to millennial time scales (low confidence) (FAQ 9.1), and suggests that reducing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations or temperatures to pre-industrial levels may not be sufficient to prevent or reverse substantial Antarctic mass losses	low	0	train
1514	AR6_WGI	1291	15	Including the peripheral glaciers of the ice sheets, the global glacier mass loss rate in the period 2000–2019 is very likely 266 ± 16 Gt yr –1 (4 [3 to 6] % of glacier mass in 2000) with an increase in the mass loss rate from 240 ± 9 Gt yr –1 in 2000–2009 to 290 ± 10 Gt yr –1 in 2010–2019	high	2	train
1515	AR6_WGI	1291	17	In summary, new evidence published since SROCC shows that, during the decade 2010–2019, glaciers lost more mass than in any other decade since the beginning of the observational record	very high	3	train

1523	AR6_WGI	1303	10	In summary, consistent projections from all generations of global climate models, elementary process understanding and strong covariance between snow cover and temperature on several time scales make it virtually certain that future Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent and duration will continue to decrease as global climate continues to warm, and process understanding strongly suggests that this also applies to Southern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover	high	2	train

1527	AR6_WGI	1304	19	While the combined mass loss for Greenland and glaciers is consistent with SROCC, updates in the underlying datasets lead to differences in partitioning of the mass loss.9.6.1.2 Global Mean Sea Level Change Budget in the Satellite Era The SROCC (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) concluded that GMSL increased at a rate of 3.16 [2.79 to 3.53, very likely range] mm yr –1 in the period 1993–2015 (the satellite altimetry era), and a rate of 3.58 [3.10 to 4.06, very likely range] mm yr –1 in the period 2006–2015 – the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)/Argo data era	high	2	train
1528	AR6_WGI	1304	20	An updated assessment for the periods 1993–2018 and 2006–2018 yields values of 3.25 [2.88 to 3.61] and 3.69 [3.21 to 4.17] mm yr –1	high	2	train
1529	AR6_WGI	1304	21	Based on the GMSL assessed time series presented in Section 2.3.3.3, GMSL acceleration is estimated as 0.075 [0.066 to 0.080] mm yr –2 for 1971–2018 and 0.094 [0.082–0.115] mm yr –2 for 1993–2018	high	2	train

1531	AR6_WGI	1304	31	Because of the increased ice-sheet mass loss, the total loss of land ice (glaciers and ice sheets) was the largest contributor to GMSL rise over the period 2006–2018	high	2	train

1533	AR6_WGI	1307	14	Adding the projected sea level change from land ice mass loss and groundwater extraction strengthens and modifies the forced signal, leading to times of emergence 10 to 20 years earlier in most parts of the ocean, except in regions close to sources of mass loss, with emergence over 50% of the ocean area by 2020, and nearly everywhere by 2100	medium	1	train

1542	AR6_WGI	1309	8	Proxy-based evidence (Section 2.3.3.3) combined with numerical modelling indicates that, on millennial time scales, the GMSL contribution arising from ice sheets was >5 m (high confidence) or >10 m	medium	1	train

1544	AR6_WGI	1309	16	In summary, geological reconstructions and numerical simulations consistently show that past warming levels of <2°C (GMST) are sufficient to trigger multi- metre mass loss from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets if maintained for millennia	high	2	train

1551	AR6_WGI	1311	11	In summary, higher-than-pre-industrial GMST during the mid-Holocene coincided with recession of the Greenland Ice Sheet to a smaller-than-present extent	high	2	train
1552	AR6_WGI	1311	14	In summary, both proxies and model simulations indicate that GMSL changes during the early to mid-Holocene were the result of episodic pulses, due to drainage of meltwater lakes, superimposed on a trend of steady rise due to continued ice-sheet retreat	high	2	train
1553	AR6_WGI	1311	15	The combination of tide gauge observations and geological reconstructions indicates that a sustained increase of GMSL began between 1820–1860 and led to a 20th-century GMSL rise that was very likely	high	2	train
1554	AR6_WGI	1311	19	In summary, rates of RSL rise exceeding the pre-industrial background rate of rise are apparent in parts of the North Atlantic in the 19th century (medium confidence), and in most of the world in the 20th century	high	2	train

1565	AR6_WGI	1323	3	On the basis of modelling studies, paleo constraints, single-ice-sheet studies finding multimillennial nonlinear responses from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Sections 9.4.1.4 and 9.4.2.6), and the underlying physics, we conclude that GMSL commitment is nonlinear in peak warming on time scales of both 2,000 and 10,000 years	medium	1	train
1566	AR6_WGI	1323	4	Although thermosteric sea level will start to decline slowly about 2,000 years after emissions cease, the slower responses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets mean that GMSL will continue to rise for 10,000 years under most scenarios	medium	1	train

1568	AR6_WGI	1324	6	In doing so, we note upfront that the main uncertainty related to high-end sea level rise is ‘when’ rather than ‘if’ it arises: the upper limit of 1.01 m of likely sea level range by 2100 for the SSP5-8.5 scenario will be exceeded in any future warming scenario on time scales of centuries to millennia	high	2	train
1569	AR6_WGI	1325	6	As in AR5 and SROCC, tide gauge observations show that RSL rise (Section 9.6.1.3) is the primary driver of changes in ESWL at most locations and, across tide gauges, has led to a median 165% increase in high-tide flooding over 1995–2014 relative to those over 1960–1980	high	2	train

1577	AR6_WGI	1326	30	The close relationship between local ESL and long-term RSL change, combined with the robust attribution of GMSL change (Section 9.6.1.4), implies that observed global changes in ESL can be attributed, at least in part, to human-caused climate change	medium	1	train
1578	AR6_WGI	1328	8	The SROCC showed that currently rare ESL events (e.g., with an average return period of 100 years) will occur annually or more frequently at most available locations for RCP4.5 by the end of the century	high	2	train
1579	AR6_WGI	1328	17	By 2100, the median frequency amplification factor is projected to be 163 for SSP1-2.6, 325 for SSP2-4.5, and 532 for SSP5-8.5, with respectively 60%, 71%, and 82% of the stations experiencing a currently 1% annual probability event at least yearly	medium	1	train
1580	AR6_WGI	1328	28	In summary, despite waves and surges being non-negligible contributors to projected ETWL and ECWL changes (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Melet et al., 2020), RSL change is expected to be the main driver in changes in future ESL return periods in most areas	medium	1	train
1581	AR6_WGI	1328	32	At local and regional scales, anthropogenic factors such as major land reclamation efforts, as in the East China Sea (Song et al., 2013) or differing national coastal management strategies (maintaining the present coastline position or managed retreat) will locally modulate the influence of GMSL rise on tidal amplitude	medium	1	train

4159	AR6_WGII	626	16	Apart from climate impacts on hydropower production, climate- induced flood loads and reservoir water level change may lead to dam failure under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios (Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2018; Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2019)	medium	1	train
4160	AR6_WGII	626	30	A systematic review showed consistent decreases in mid to end of the century in thermal power production capacity due to insufficiency of cooling water in southern, western and eastern Europe (high confidence); North America and Oceania (high confidence), central, southern and western Asia (high confidence) and western and southern Africa	medium	1	train
4161	AR6_WGII	626	31	Overall, apart from emissions benefits, moving away from thermal power generation to other renewable energy will also lower the chances of climate-induced curtailment of energy production	high	2	train

4163	AR6_WGII	627	5	In addition, both SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018a) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019b) projected the risk from droughts, heavy precipitation, water scarcity, wildfire damage and permafrost degradation to be higher at 2°C warming than 1.5°C	medium	1	train
4164	AR6_WGII	627	6	Waterborne diseases result from complex causal relationships between climatic, environmental and socioeconomic factors that are not fully understood or modelled (Boholm and Prutzer, 2017)	high	2	train
4165	AR6_WGII	627	8	In addition, changes in thermotolerance and chlorine resistance of certain viruses have been observed in laboratory experiments simulating different temperatures and sunlight conditions (Carratalà et al., 2020), increasing potential health risks even where traditional water treatment exists (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014)	low	0	train

4168	AR6_WGII	628	13	In summary, rapid population growth, urbanisation, ageing infrastructure and changes in water use are responsible for increasing the vulnerability of urban and peri-urban areas to extreme rainfall and drought, particularly in less developed economies with limited governance capacity	high	2	train
4169	AR6_WGII	628	14	In addition, modified stream flows due to climate change (Section 4.4.3) are projected to affect the amount and variability of inflows to storage reservoirs that serve urban areas and may exacerbate challenges to reservoir capacity, such as sedimentation and poor water quality	high	2	train
4170	AR6_WGII	628	16	Rising water temperatures are also projected to cause shifts in freshwater species distribution and worsen water quality problems	high	2	train
4171	AR6_WGII	629	14	Furthermore, according to IPCC SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), if the world warms by 2°C–4°C by 2050, rates of human conflict could increase, but again, the role of hydrological change in this was not explicit	medium	1	train
4172	AR6_WGII	629	16	Yet, since both conflictive and cooperative events are possible under conditions of climatic variability, whether conflict arises or increases depends on several contextual socioeconomic and political factors, including the adaptive capacity of the riparian states (Koubi, 2019), the existence of power asymmetries (Dinar et al., 2019) and pre-existing social tensions	medium	1	train
4173	AR6_WGII	629	18	However, to date, other factors are considered more influential drivers of conflict, including lack of natural resource use regulations (Linke et al., 2018b), societal exclusion (von Uexkull et al., 2016; van Weezel, 2019), poor infrastructures and a history of violent conflict (Detges, 2016)	high	2	train
4174	AR6_WGII	629	21	On the other side, intergroup cohesion (De Juan and Hänze, 2020) and policies that improve societal development and good governance reduce the risk of conflict associated with the challenges to adaptation to climate change (Hegre et al., 2016; Witmer et al., 2017)	medium	1	train
4175	AR6_WGII	629	24	In addition, recent scenario analysis in global transboundary basins supports the finding that there is more potential for conflict in areas already under water stress, such as central Asia and the northern parts of Africa (Munia et al., 2020)	medium	1	train

4189	AR6_WGII	634	25	The effects of temperature increase, changing rainfall patterns, sea level rise and population pressure combined with limited options available for water-related adaptation leave small islands partially water-insecure currently, with increasing risks in the near-term and at warming above 1.5°C	high	2	train
4190	AR6_WGII	635	2	There is high confidence that water-related adaptation is occurring in the agricultural sector (Acevedo et al., 2020; Ricciardi et al., 2020), and water-related adaptation in the agricultural sector makes up the majority of documented local, regional and global evidence of implemented adaptation	high	2	test
4191	AR6_WGII	635	3	However, while there is increasing evidence of adaptation and its benefits across multiple dimensions, the link between adaptation benefits and climate risk reduction is unclear due to methodological challenges	medium	1	train
4192	AR6_WGII	635	4	On the other hand, while it is methodologically possible to measure the effectiveness of future adaptation in reducing climate risks, the main limitation here is that not all possible ranges of future adaptations can be modelled given the limitations of climate and impact models	high	2	train
4193	AR6_WGII	635	10	This measure is deemed to have economic benefits and benefits for vulnerable communities who adopt this measure (high confidence) and benefits in terms of water saving and positive ecological and sociocultural benefits	medium	1	train

4195	AR6_WGII	636	14	In sum, water-related adaptation in the agricultural sector is widely documented, with irrigation, agricultural water management, crop diversification and improved agronomic practices among the most common adaptation measures adopted	high	2	train
4196	AR6_WGII	636	25	Overall, freshwater withdrawals for adapted cooling systems under all scenarios are projected to decline by −3% to −63% by 2100 compared to the base year of 2000 (Fricko et al., 2016)	medium	1	train
4197	AR6_WGII	636	30	Furthermore, reducing the share of thermoelectric power with solar and wind energy (Tobin et al., 2018; Arango-Aramburo et al., 2019; Emodi et al., 2019) can be synergistic from both climate and water perspectives, as solar and wind energy have lower water footprints	high	2	train
4198	AR6_WGII	636	34	For instance, sharing of hydropower revenues and profits to fund local infrastructure and pay dividends to local people has been practiced in Nepal and in some countries of the Mekong basin to enhance the social acceptability of hydropower projects (Balasubramanya et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2016)	low	0	train
4199	AR6_WGII	637	28	Further, while irrigation expansion is one of the most commonly proposed adaptation responses, there are limitations to further increases in water use, as many regions are already facing water limitations under current climatic conditions	high	2	train
4200	AR6_WGII	638	6	However, residual risks will remain, especially at higher levels of warming	medium	1	train
4201	AR6_WGII	638	10	WaSH interventions have been demonstrated to reduce diarrhoea risk by 25–75% depending on the specific intervention (Wolf et al., 2018)	high	2	train
4202	AR6_WGII	638	11	Conversely, inadequate WaSH is associated with an estimated annual loss of 50 million daily adjusted life years (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2019), of which 89% of deaths are due to diarrhoea, and 8% of deaths from acute respiratory infections (Chapter 7 WGII 7.3.2), making universal access to WaSH (i.e., achievement of SDG 6.1, 6.2) a critical adaptation strategy	high	2	train
4203	AR6_WGII	638	16	Improved integrated (urban) water resources management (Kirshen et al., 2018; Tosun and Leopold, 2019) and governance (Chu, 2017; Miller et al., 2020) and enhanced ecosystem management (Adhikari et al., 2018b) lead to policies and regulations that reduce water insecurity and, when developed appropriately, reduce inequities	medium	1	train
4204	AR6_WGII	638	17	Supply (source) augmentation, including dams, storage and rainwater/fog harvesting, can increase the supply or reliability of water for drinking, sanitation and hygiene (DeNicola et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2015; Majuru et al., 2016; Poudel and Duex, 2017; Lucier and Qadir, 2018; Goodrich et al., 2019)	high	2	train
4205	AR6_WGII	638	22	Demand for water can be decreased through reductions in water loss from the system (e.g., pipe leakage) (Orlove et al., 2019) and water conservation measures (Duran-Encalada et al., 2017)	medium	1	train
4206	AR6_WGII	639	22	Further analyses of co-benefits, particularly employing a gender lens, are required to improve adaptation strategies (McIver et al., 2016).In summary, ensuring access to climate-resilient WaSH infrastructure and practices represents a key adaptation strategy that can protect beneficiaries against water-related diseases induced by climate change	high	2	train
4207	AR6_WGII	639	23	Better management of water resources, supply augmentation and demand management are important adaptation strategies	high	2	train
4208	AR6_WGII	640	15	In summary, although water-related adaptation is underway in the urban, peri-urban and municipal sectors of some nations, governance, technical and economic barriers remain in implementing locally informed strategies, particularly in developing countries (high confidence).4.6.6 Adaptation for Communities Dependent on Freshwater Ecosystems AR5 concluded that some adaptation responses in the urban and agricultural sectors could negatively impact freshwater ecosystems	medium	1	train
4209	AR6_WGII	640	17	These have been implemented in many locations around the world, yet, challenges remain, including improving the evidence base of their effectiveness, scaling up of these interventions, mainstreaming across sectors and receiving more adaptation finance	medium	1	train
4210	AR6_WGII	640	25	These measures also require further financial support, mainstreaming across sectors and the scaling up of individual measures	medium	1	train

4212	AR6_WGII	643	11	At the urban and peri-urban scale, the use and effectiveness of NbS is a crucial feature to build resilience in cities for urban stormwater management and heat mitigation (Depietri and McPhearson, 2017; Carter et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020; Babí Almenar et al., 2021)	high	2	train
4213	AR6_WGII	643	20	Moreover, several NbS– —for example, natural (blue and green) and grey infrastructure—can help address water-related hazards such as coastal hazards, heavy precipitation, drought, erosion and low water quality	high	2	train
4214	AR6_WGII	644	4	Vulnerable populations exposed to hydrological changes may become trapped due to a lack of economic and social capital required for migration (Adams, 2016; Zickgraf, 2018)	medium	1	train
4215	AR6_WGII	644	7	Migration has increased vulnerability among women and female-headed households (Patel and Giri, 2019), but has also triggered gender-positive processes such as increased female school enrolment (Gioli et al., 2014)	medium	1	train
4216	AR6_WGII	644	8	Remittances, that is, transfers of money from migrants to beneficiaries in sending areas, may reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to climate-induced hydrological changes (Ng’ang’a et al., 2016; Jha et al., 2018b)	medium	1	train
4217	AR6_WGII	644	11	However, they often fail to include affected populations in the process and may lead to greater impoverishment and increased vulnerability (Wilmsen and Webber, 2015)	medium	1	train
4218	AR6_WGII	644	14	In summary, measures that facilitate successful migration and inclusive resettlement may facilitate adaptation to climate-induced hydrological changes	medium	1	train
4219	AR6_WGII	644	28	However, relocation can be culturally, socially, financially, politically and geographically constrained due to the importance of cultural relationships with traditional, customary or ancestral lands	high	2	train
4220	AR6_WGII	645	6	In sum, although some Indigenous Peoples, local communities and traditional peoples can adapt, and are adapting to climate-driven hydrological changes, and their impacts on and risks to culturally significant practices and beliefs (medium confidence), these strategies are constrained by structural barriers and adaptation limits	high	2	train
4221	AR6_WGII	646	26	Most of these adaptation case studies are from Asia and Africa, and agriculture is the predominant sector where most of these adaptation responses are being implemented	high	2	train

4225	AR6_WGII	654	16	In developing countries, most adaptation measures improve economic outcomes	high	2	train
4226	AR6_WGII	654	17	Adaptation responses also have benefits in terms of water outcomes and environmental and ecological parameters, and these benefits are more commonly manifested in developed countries	high	2	train
4227	AR6_WGII	654	18	Of the papers assessed for water-related adaptation, roughly one fourth reported adaptation co-benefits	high	2	train
4228	AR6_WGII	654	19	In contrast, one third of studies reported maladaptive outcomes, now or in the future	high	2	train

4230	AR6_WGII	656	19	Results show a range of effectiveness levels across regions and warming levels and vary depending on the tested response options (Qin et al., 2018) (Figure 4.29), with moderate to small effectiveness, large residual impacts or potential maladaptive outcomes, as well as decreasing effectiveness with increasing warming (Figure 4.28)	high	2	train
4231	AR6_WGII	656	28	For all regions, a reduction in effectiveness is apparent from 1.5°C to higher levels of warming, leading to increased residual risk with increasing warming	high	2	train
4232	AR6_WGII	656	29	Irrigation can increase yield relative to present day, showing co-benefits for some regions, though the share of co-benefits decreases with higher warming	high	2	train
4233	AR6_WGII	658	22	Adaptation generally performs more effectively at 1.5°C, though residual damages are projected at this warming level across sectors and regions	high	2	train
4234	AR6_WGII	660	8	Reduction in the effectiveness of future adaptation at higher global warming levels emphasises the need for limiting warming to 1.5°C, as space for adaptation solution starts to shrink beyond that for most options for which future projections exists	high	2	train
4235	AR6_WGII	660	10	First, the nature of literature on current adaptation makes it challenging to infer their effectiveness in reducing climate risks, even though the benefits of adaptation are clear	high	2	train
4236	AR6_WGII	660	15	SR1.5 also shows that water-related risks can be reduced substantially by limiting warming to 1.5°C	high	2	train

4240	AR6_WGII	663	4	In summary, institutional constraints (governance, institutions, policy), including path dependency and financial and information constraints, are the main challenge to adaptation implementation in the water sector	high	2	train
4241	AR6_WGII	663	5	Water-related losses and damages that manifest despite or beyond implemented adaptation have been observed across world regions, primarily for exposed and vulnerable communities	high	2	train
4242	AR6_WGII	663	20	So, while there is general agreement about negative impacts on GDP due to water-related risks in the future, the magnitude of GDP loss estimates varies substantially and depends on various model assumptions	high	2	train
4243	AR6_WGII	664	1	In summary, climate change impacts on water resources are projected to lower GDP in many low-and middle-income countries without adequate adaptation measures	high	2	train
4244	AR6_WGII	664	4	Still, more work needs to be done on actual benefits and costs of adaptation strategies and residual impacts and risks of delaying adaptation action	medium	1	train
4245	AR6_WGII	664	5	In addition, better evidence on the costs and benefits of low-regret solutions, such as water pricing, increasing water use efficiency through technology and service improvements, and enhanced support for autonomous adaptation, is also needed for informed decision-making	high	2	train
4246	AR6_WGII	664	8	Different mitigation pathways can either increase or decrease water withdrawals or water consumption (or both, or either) depending on the specific combination of mitigation technologies deployed	high	2	train
4247	AR6_WGII	665	14	Some DAC technologies that include solid sorbents also produce water as a by-product, but not in quantities that can offset total water losses (Beuttler et al., 2019; Fasihi et al., 2019)	medium	1	train
4248	AR6_WGII	665	16	Results from a simulation study on retrofitting coal- fired power plants built after 2000 with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies show an increase in global water consumption, currently at 9.66 km3 yr–1, by 31–50% (to 12.66 km3 yr–1 and 14.47 km3 yr–1, respectively) depending on the cooling and CCS technology deployed, and hence are best deployed in locations which are not water scarce (Rosa et al., 2020c)	medium	1	train
4249	AR6_WGII	665	18	Carbon can be ‘scrubbed’ from thermoelectric power plant emissions and injected for storage in deep geological strata (Turner et al., 2018), but this can lead to pollution of deep aquifers (Chen et al., 2021) and have health consequences	low	0	train
4250	AR6_WGII	665	32	Overall, extensive BECCS and afforestation/reforestation deployment can alter the water cycle at regional scales	high	2	train
4251	AR6_WGII	666	2	Many mitigation measures have a considerable water footprint	high	2	train
4252	AR6_WGII	666	34	The effectiveness of technology in reducing climate-related risks depends on its appropriateness to the local context (Biagini et al., 2014; Mfitumukiza et al., 2020) and other factors, including institutional and governance frameworks	high	2	train
4253	AR6_WGII	667	2	Water-related technologies can also have adverse distributional outcomes when gains from technology adoption accrue disproportionately to a small section of the population; for example, only rich and male farmers can adopt high-cost technologies like solar irrigation pumps (Gupta, 2019)	medium	1	test
4254	AR6_WGII	667	14	Such financing focuses on returns and scale (Cholibois, 2020), and as such, local needs, especially those of the poor, may not be adequately represented (Manuamorn et al., 2020; Williams, 2020)	medium	1	test

4262	AR6_WGII	669	13	Effective participation of these actors in climate change adaptation planning in the water sector can contribute to more just adaptation actions	high	2	train
4263	AR6_WGII	669	28	Therefore, the legitimacy of the decisions taken by multiple decision-makers at different levels of water governance derives from the perceived fairness of the decision-making process (Baldwin et al., 2018) and the inclusion of women, Indigenous Peoples and young people (Iza, 2019)	medium	1	train
4264	AR6_WGII	670	1	Polycentric governance systems require cross- scale information sharing, coordination and democratic participation to work appropriately (Pahl-Wostl and Knieper, 2014; Carlisle and Gruby, 2017; Morrison et al., 2017; Biesbroek and Lesnikowski, 2018; Frey et al., 2021)	high	2	test
4265	AR6_WGII	670	4	These, in turn, can produce better environmental outcomes and improve water governance outcomes	high	2	train
4266	AR6_WGII	670	8	For instance, historical inequities and injustices due to settler colonialism and top-down water policies, governance and laws (Collins et al., 2017; Arsenault et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2018; Robison et al., 2018) have resulted in long-term water insecurity in many indigenous communities in North America (Simms et al., 2016; Medeiros et al., 2017; Conroy-Ben and Richard, 2018; Diver, 2018; Emanuel, 2018)	high	2	train
4267	AR6_WGII	670	12	In summary, polycentric governance can enable improved water governance and effective climate change adaptation	medium	1	train

4269	AR6_WGII	670	30	Evidence suggests that adaptation failure in the water sector is due to policy and regulatory failures (Keohane and Victor, 2016; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018; Javeline et al., 2019), reflecting political myopia (Muller, 2018; Empinotti et al., 2019; Pralle, 2019)	high	2	train

5833	AR6_WGII	1886	22	The transition to moderate risk is currently happening as warming already results in changes in timing of development, species migration northward and upwards, and desynchronisation of species interactions, especially at the range limits, with cascading and cumulative impacts through ecosystems and food webs	high	2	train
5834	AR6_WGII	1886	25	The transition is happening at slightly higher warming in terrestrial systems due to a higher number of thermal refugia in terrestrial systems causing relocation but not already severe impacts	medium	1	train

5837	AR6_WGII	1887	3	To reach high adaptation, a combination of low, medium and high effectiveness measures in different sectors and sub-regions is needed, many of which entail systems’ transformations (e.g., heat-proof land management) (Chapter 16) and remain effective at higher warming levels	medium	1	train

5868	AR6_WGII	1895	13	Yet, high GWL scenarios beyond 2100 are often not considered in climate-change adaptation planning due to a lack of perceived usability, missing socioeconomic information, constraining institutional settings and conflicting decision-making timeframes	medium	1	train

6972	AR6_WGII	2591	13	Overall, there is growing evidence that effective implementation of strategies developed for deeply uncertain problems require adequate mandates and funding frameworks, preparedness and disaster response plans, and monitoring and evaluation of the strategy outcomes, against how the future unfolds	medium	1	train

6998	AR6_WGII	2611	25	The literature is converging to suggest that successful adaptation broadly refers to actions and policies that effectively and substantially reduce climate vulnerability, and exposure to and/or impacts of climate risk (Noble et al., 2014; Juhola et al., 2016), while creating synergies to other climate-related goals, increasing benefits to non-climate- related goals (such as current and future economic, societal and other environmental goals) and minimise trade-offs (Grafakos et al., 2019) across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values (Eriksen et al., 2015; Gajjar et al., 2019a; Owen, 2020)	high	2	train

7002	AR6_WGII	2614	12	For example, particular attention should be paid to prioritising benefits to low-income groups and leveraging the transformational potential of adaptation (having the largest number of large circles), that is, many evaluated options become maladaptive by exacerbating the vulnerability of low-income groups and by fortifying the status quo	medium	1	train

7006	AR6_WGII	2618	14	The majority of adaptation M&E efforts have so far focused on processes and outputs rather than on achieved outcomes such as climate risks, vulnerability, well-being or development (Droesch et al., 2008; GIZ and Adelphi, 2017; UNDP Cambodia, 2014; Fawcett et al., 2017)	high	2	train
7007	AR6_WGII	2618	17	Instead, they suggest that multiple complementary approaches combined with higher-frequency data collection produce a more elaborate picture of the effects of adaptation and resilience responses (Jones and d’Errico, 2019; Knippenberg et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019; Jones, 2019a; see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter)	medium	1	train

7011	AR6_WGII	2622	1	Yet very few scientific studies have addressed the adaptation-specific aspects of the Global Stocktake (Craft and Fisher, 2018; Tompkins et al., 2018), and there are different views and options on how assessing global progress could take place	high	2	train
7012	AR6_WGII	2622	15	Due to the challenges inherent in measuring adaptation outcomes (Sections 16.3, 17.5.1 and 17.5.2.5), most global assessments to date have focused on outputs, such as whether countries have adopted adaptation plans (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021; UNEP , 2021a)	high	2	train

7021	AR6_WGII	2625	5	Importantly, adaptations need to be designed to not only combat current and future climate risks but also ensure that they do not lock in undesirable pathways in the future as risks develop and change	very high	3	train
7022	AR6_WGII	2625	6	Effective management of climate risks will therefore be dependent on satisfactorily managing current climate risks (Boxes 17.1, 17.2, 17.5), coupled with assessing prognoses for future climate risks, and developing responses in advance for reducing those risks to tolerable residual levels	very high	3	train
7023	AR6_WGII	2625	7	The dynamic nature of risk (Viner et al., 2019; Simpson et al., 2021; Sections 16.3, 16.6) also means that the contribution of current adaptations to ameliorating future risks needs to be regularly reviewed	high	2	train

7057	AR6_WGII	2670	20	For example, grounding adaptation actions in local realities could help to ensure that adaptive actions do not worsen existing gender and other inequities within society (e.g., leading to maladaptation practices)	high	2	train
7058	AR6_WGII	2670	24	Pursuing CRD involves considering a broader range of sustainable development priorities, policies and practices, as well as enabling societal choices to accelerate and deepen their implementation	very high	3	train
7059	AR6_WGII	2671	5	The literature presenting research findings on climate resilient development (CRD) and pathways and processes for successfully achieving CRD has expanded significantly in the several years since the AR5	very high	3	train
7060	AR6_WGII	2671	7	Furthermore, the literature describing the role of system transitions and societal transformation in enabling climate action (Box 18.1, Section 18.3), compliance with the Paris Agreement (Sections 18.1.3, 18.2.1) and achievement of the SDGs (Section 18.1.3; Box 18.4) has expanded significantly	very high	3	train
7061	AR6_WGII	2671	13	However, studies that explicitly refer to CRD as a concept or a guide for policy and practice remain modest	very high	3	train
7062	AR6_WGII	2672	3	Moreover, current commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not yet consistent with limiting changes in global mean temperature elevation to well-below 2°C or 1.5°C	very high	3	train
7063	AR6_WGII	2672	5	Exceeding these boundaries poses increased risk of large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes that would threaten human and ecological well-being	very high	3	train
7064	AR6_WGII	2672	31	Furthermore, while a given pathway might lead to a set of desired outcomes for one region or set of actors, the process of getting there may come at high environmental, socio- and economic cost to others	very high	3	train
7065	AR6_WGII	2677	11	Since the AR5, the volume of research at the nexus of climate action and sustainable development has changed markedly	very high	3	train
7066	AR6_WGII	2677	13	Nevertheless, the concept of resilience generally, and CRD specifically, has come under increasing criticism in recent years	very high	3	train
7067	AR6_WGII	2677	22	For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have reversed gains over the past several years in terms of global poverty reduction	very high	3	train
7068	AR6_WGII	2677	26	For example, recent literature on CRD emphasises the urgency of climate action that achieve significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the implementation of adaptation options that result in significant gains in human and natural system resilience	very high	3	train
7069	AR6_WGII	2678	8	Second, CRD is dependent on achieving transitions in key systems including energy, land and ecosystem, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems	very high	3	train
7070	AR6_WGII	2678	20	Fifth, CRD involves processes involving diverse actors, at different scales operating within an environmental, developmental, socioeconomic, cultural and political context, as typified in the SDG and the Paris Agreement negotiations	very high	3	train
7071	AR6_WGII	2679	9	Systems transitions alone are insufficient to achieve the rapid, fundamental and comprehensive changes required for humanity and planetary health in the face of climate change	high	2	train
7072	AR6_WGII	2679	10	Transformative action is increasingly urgent across all sectors, systems and scales to avert dangerous climate change and meet the SDGs (Pelling et al., 2015; IPCC, 2018a; IPCC, 2021b; Shi and Moser, 2021; Vogel and O’Brien, 2021)	high	2	train
7073	AR6_WGII	2679	13	Transformative actions aimed at ‘deliberately and fundamentally changing systems to achieve more just and equitable outcomes’, (Shi and Moser, 2021: 2) shift pathways towards climate resilient development (CRD)	high	2	train
7074	AR6_WGII	2679	15	Climate actions that support CRD are embedded in these dimensions of development; for example, social cohesion and equity, individual and collective agency, and democratising knowledge processes have been identified as steps to transform practices and governance systems for increased resilience (Ziervogel et al., 2016b; Nightingale et al., 2020; Colloff et al., 2021; Vogel and O’Brien, 2021)	high	2	train
7075	AR6_WGII	2679	20	Transformation may require actions that disrupt moral or social boundaries and structures that are perpetuating unsustainable systems and pathways (Vogel and O’Brien, 2021)	high	2	train
7076	AR6_WGII	2679	21	Extreme events and long-term climatic changes can trigger a realigning of practices, politics and knowledge (Carr, 2019; Schipper et al., 2020b)	high	2	train
7077	AR6_WGII	2679	23	Climate shocks, when managed within socio-political systems in ways that safeguard rather than alter practices and structures, can also reinforce rather than shift the status quo (Mosberg et al., 2017; Carr, 2019; Marmot and Allen, 2020; Arifeen and Nyborg, 2021)	high	2	train
7078	AR6_WGII	2680	1	There has been an increase in transformative actions taking place through city-level resilience building aimed at shifting inequitable relations and opening up space for a plurality of actors (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018; Ziervogel et al., 2021)	high	2	train
7079	AR6_WGII	2680	4	Transformative actions meet resistance by precisely the political, social, knowledge and technical systems and structures they are attempting to transform (Blythe et al., 2018; Shi and Moser, 2021)	high	2	train
7080	AR6_WGII	2680	5	There is expanding evidence that many adaptation efforts have failed to be transformative, but instead entrenched inequities, exacerbated power imbalances and reinforced vulnerability among marginalised groups and that, instead, marginalised groups and future trends in vulnerability need to be placed at the centre of adaptation planning (Atteridge and Remling, 2018; Mikulewicz, 2019; Owen, 2020; Eriksen et al., 2021a; Eriksen et al., 2021b; Garschagen et al., 2021)	high	2	train
7081	AR6_WGII	2682	1	Others may experience acute challenges with adaptation due to existing vulnerability associated with poverty and social inequality	very high	3	train
7082	AR6_WGII	2682	3	While demonstrable progress has been made towards the SDGs and improving human well-being, globally and in specific nations, some observed patterns of development are inconsistent with sustainable development and the principles of CRD	very high	3	train
7083	AR6_WGII	2682	14	While there are many possible successful pathways to future development in the context of climate change, history shows that pathways positive for the vast majority of people typically induce significant impacts and costs, especially on marginal and vulnerable people	high	2	test
7084	AR6_WGII	2683	28	As empirical studies in the Global South have demonstrated (Lele et al., 2018), developing countries face multiple stressors, climate change being just one among them, and there are multiple normative concerns in developing country contexts, such as equity and justice, and not merely resilience	very high	3	train
7085	AR6_WGII	2685	10	For example, pathways that lead to poverty reduction can have synergies with food security, water, gender, terrestrial and ocean ecosystems that support climate risk management, but also poverty alleviation projects with unintended negative consequences that increase vulnerability (e.g., Ley, 2017; Ley et al., 2020).While the scenarios literature is useful for characterising the potential climate risk implications of different global societal futures, important limitations impact their use in climate risk management planning	very high	3	train
7086	AR6_WGII	2686	4	Importantly, the scenarios literature overall has found trade-offs such that none of the global societal projections achieve all the SDGs	very high	3	train
7087	AR6_WGII	2686	14	For all climate projections and variables, there is significant regional heterogeneity and uncertainty in projected climate change	very high	3	train
7088	AR6_WGII	2687	5	Thus, adaptation interventions and pathways can further the achievement of development goals such as food security (Campbell et al., 2016; Douxchamps et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2018; Bezner Kerr et al., 2019) and improvements in human health (Watts et al., 2019) including in systems where animals and humans live in close proximity	very high	3	train

7091	AR6_WGII	2690	3	Adaptation gaps or deficits arise from a lack of adequate technological, financial, social, and institutional capacities to adapt effectively to climate change and extreme weather events, which are in turn linked to development	very high	3	train
7092	AR6_WGII	2690	7	Despite the challenges of measurement associated with adaptation gaps, available evidence from smaller scales across several regions, communities and businesses suggest that significant adaptation gaps have existed in historical contexts of climate change, while expectations of extreme heat, increasing storm intensity and rising sea levels will create the context for the emergence of new gaps	very high	3	train
7093	AR6_WGII	2690	10	A higher level of adaptation finance is critical to enhance adaptation planning and implementation and reduce adaptation gaps, particularly in developing countries	very high	3	train
7094	AR6_WGII	2694	1	There are numerous individual and system mitigation options throughout the economy and within human and natural systems	very high	3	train
7095	AR6_WGII	2694	2	Limiting global average warming has been found to reduce climate risks (IPCC, 2018a; IPCC, 2019b), and limiting global average warming to any temperature level has also been found to be associated with broad ranges of potential global emissions pathways that represent future uncertainty in the evolution of socioeconomic, technological, market and physical systems	very high	3	train
7096	AR6_WGII	2695	16	In general, mitigation alters development opportunities by constraining the emissions future society can produce, which affects markets, resource allocation, economic structure, income distribution, consumers and the environment (besides climate)	very high	3	train
7097	AR6_WGII	2698	21	Nonlinearities have been estimated in global and regional mitigation costs and potential economic damages from climate change	very high	3	train
7098	AR6_WGII	2698	28	Not only do trade-offs vary by climate level, as do synergies, but they increase at an increasing rate and their relative importance can shift across climate levels	very high	3	train
7099	AR6_WGII	2698	31	For instance, additional mitigation options and more economically efficient policy designs have been shown to reduce mitigation costs and the nonlinearities in mitigation costs	very high	3	train
7100	AR6_WGII	2699	1	Central to this framing is a shift away from viewing adaptation as discrete sets of options that are selected and implemented to manage risk, to thinking about adaptation as a social process that evolves over time, includes multiple decision points, and requires dynamic adjustments in response to new information about climate risk, socioeconomic conditions and the value of potential adaptation responses	very high	3	train
7101	AR6_WGII	2699	3	While ensuring development and adaptation produce synergies that allow for the achievement of sustainable development is challenging, modelling exercises suggest that there are pathways where synergies among the SDGs are realised	very high	3	train
7102	AR6_WGII	2699	22	Synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development might be promoted by prioritising those CRD strategies most likely to generate synergies	very high	3	test
7103	AR6_WGII	2699	24	Similarly, trade- offs might be managed by prioritising strategies such as disqualifying mitigation options thought to have negative social implications (Section 18.2.5.3.1), internalising externalities, such as placing a fee or constraint on a negative externality or related activity (Dubash et al., 2022) (Bistline and Rose, 2018), or using complementary policies, such as transfer payments to offset negative mitigation, adaptation or sustainable development strategy implications	very high	3	train
7104	AR6_WGII	2700	9	Globally, low climate change projections, versus higher climate change projections, imply greater mitigation, lower climate risks and less adaptation. This implies greater mitigation trade-offs in terms of overall economic development, food crop prices, energy prices and overall household consumption, but lower climate risk, with sustainable development synergies such as human health and lower adaptation trade-offs, and an uneven distribution of effects	very high	3	test
7105	AR6_WGII	2700	29	Prioritising sustainable development locally is also supported by the insight that the impacts on poverty depend at least as much or more on development than on the level of climate change	very high	3	train
7106	AR6_WGII	2701	2	In the climate change solution space, system transitions represent an important mechanism for linking and enabling mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development options and actions	very high	3	train
7107	AR6_WGII	2701	12	This growth in demand, however, has been moderated by improvements in energy efficiency in industry, buildings and transportation sectors	very high	3	train
7108	AR6_WGII	2701	14	Features of sustainable development, such as enhanced energy access, energy security, reductions in air pollution and economic growth, continue to be the dominant influence on the evolution of energy systems and decision making regarding energy investments and portfolios	very high	3	train
7109	AR6_WGII	2701	16	Yet there are examples at the local, regional and national level of policy incentivising rapid changes in energy systems	very high	3	train
7110	AR6_WGII	2701	17	Many sustainable development priorities have co-benefits in terms of climate mitigation, such as air pollution and conservation policies reducing short-lived climate forcers and sequestering carbon respectively, as well adaptation benefits, such as improved energy access and environmental quality enhancing adaptive capacity	very high	3	train
7111	AR6_WGII	2701	24	Energy systems have been a historical driver of climate change, but are also adversely affected by climate change impacts, including short- term shocks and stressors from extreme weather as well as long-term shifts in climatic conditions	very high	3	train
7112	AR6_WGII	2702	1	Available literature indicates that greenhouse gas emissions reductions have been achieved in response to climate actions including financial incentives to promote renewable energy, carbon taxes and emissions trading, removal of fossil fuel subsidies, and promotion of energy efficiency standards	very high	3	train
7113	AR6_WGII	2703	1	Rather, urban areas are increasingly conceptualised as complex socio-ecological or socio- technical systems	very high	3	train
7114	AR6_WGII	2703	3	Urban transitions will be associated with synergies as well as trade-offs with respect to sustainable development	very high	3	test

7119	AR6_WGII	2712	10	Water insecurity and the lack of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure have resulted in psychosocial distress and gender-based violence, as well as poor maternal and child health and nutrition (Collins et al., 2019a; Wilson et al., 2019; Geere and Hunter, 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Mainali et al., 2020) (Sections 4.3.3 and 4.6.4.4)	high	2	train
7120	AR6_WGII	2712	15	Increased domestic responsibilities of women and youth, due to migration of men, can increase their vulnerability due to their reduced capacity for investment in off-farm activities and reduced access to information (Sugden et al., 2014; O’Neil et al., 2017) (Sections 4.3, 4.6)	high	2	train
7121	AR6_WGII	2712	20	In most regions where there are climate change policies that consider gender, they inadequately address structural inequalities resulting from climate change impacts, or how gender and other social inequalities can compound risk	high	2	train
7122	AR6_WGII	2713	6	However, attention to the following has the potential to bring about change: Creation of new, deliberative policymaking spaces that support inclusive decision making processes and opportunities to (re)negotiate pervasive gender and other social inequalities in the context of climate change for transformation (Tschakert et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2018; Ziervogel, 2019; Garcia et al., 2020)	high	2	train

7126	AR6_WGII	2716	13	The agency of people to act on CRD is grounded in their worldviews, beliefs, values and consciousness (Woiwode, 2020), and is shaped through social and political processes including how policies and decision making recognise the voices, knowledges and rights of particular actors over others	very high	3	train
7127	AR6_WGII	2717	10	Given these insights, CRD can be understood as the sum of complex multi-dimensional processes consisting of large numbers of actions and societal choices made by multiple actors from government, the private sector and civil society, with important influences by science and the media	very high	3	train
7128	AR6_WGII	2718	7	However, the pursuit of a given NDC within a specific country will likely necessitate a range of other policy interventions that have more immediate impact on technologies and behaviour, implicating transitions in energy, industry, land and infrastructure	very high	3	train
7129	AR6_WGII	2718	10	As reflected by the SDGs (and SDG 13 specifically), the mainstreaming of climate change concerns into development policies is one mechanism for pursuing sustainable development and CRD	very high	3	train

7137	AR6_WGII	2720	12	There is agreement in this literature that such an approach allows for the effective integration of climate challenges into existing policy and planning processes	very high	3	train
7138	AR6_WGII	2720	21	However, access to, and the benefits of, that innovation have not been evenly distributed among global regions and communities, and continued innovation is needed to facilitate climate action and sustainable development	very high	3	train
7139	AR6_WGII	2721	35	The need to assess resilience and adaptation against a background of evolving climate hazards, and to link resilience and adaptation with development outcomes, present further methodological challenges (very high confidence) (Brooks et al., 2014).Currently, the ability to monitor different components of CRD are in various stages of maturity	very high	3	train

7160	AR6_WGII	2733	3	Given outcomes in many systems including public health, agriculture, ecosystems and biodiversity, and infrastructure are often associated with biophysical thresholds (e.g., physiological or design thresholds), those regions where such thresholds are increasingly exceeded due to climate change may experience disproportionately higher impacts	very high	3	train

7557	AR6_WGIII	239	5	These studies indicate that, for mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (<67%) above pre-industrial levels or lower, using GWP100 to inform cost-effective abatement choices between gases would achieve such long-term temperature goals at close to least global cost within a few percent	high	2	train
7558	AR6_WGIII	239	6	Using the dynamic GTP instead of GWP100 could reduce global mitigation costs by a few percent in theory (high confidence), but the ability to realise those cost savings depends on the temperature limit, policy foresight and flexibility in abatement choices as the weighting of SLCF emissions increases over time	medium	1	train

7601	AR6_WGIII	353	1	CDR deployment in pathways serves multiple purposes: accelerating the pace of emissions reductions, offsetting residual emissions, and creating the option for net negative CO 2 emissions in case temperature reductions need to be achieved in the long term	high	2	train
7602	AR6_WGIII	353	3	CDR through some measures in AFOLU can be maintained for decades but not in the very long term because these sinks will ultimately saturate	high	2	train

7626	AR6_WGIII	413	10	Pathways that correspond to NDCs announced prior to COP26 in 2030 and strengthen action after 2030 imply higher marginal abatement costs of carbon in the longer run than pathways with stronger immediate global mitigation action (Figure 3.32b)	high	2	train

7936	AR6_WGIII	1773	11	The AR5 concluded that published assessments of financial flows whose expected effect was to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change aggregated USD343–385 billion4 yr–1 globally between 2010 and 2012	medium	1	train
7937	AR6_WGIII	1774	1	The resulting estimated gaps in annual mitigation financing during 2014 to 2017, using reporting of climate financing from published sources, was about 67% for 2015, and 76% for the energy sector alone in 2017	medium	1	train
7938	AR6_WGIII	1774	6	The gap is expected to be aggravated by COVID-19	high	2	train
7939	AR6_WGIII	1774	19	Four major events and macro trends mark the developments in climate finance in the previous five years and likely developments in the near term.• First, the 2015 Paris Agreement, with the engagement of the financial sector institutions in the climate agenda, has been followed by a series of related developments in financial regulation in relation to climate change and in particular to the disclosure of climate-related financial risk	high	2	train
7940	AR6_WGIII	1774	22	At the same time, while it is still too early to draw positive conclusions, this crisis highlights opportunities in terms of political and policy feasibility and behavioural change in respect of realigning climate finance	medium	1	train
7941	AR6_WGIII	1776	4	As each warmer year keeps producing more negative impacts – arising from greater and rising variability and intensity of rainfall, floods, droughts, forest fires and storms – the negative consequences have become more macro- economically significant, and worst for the most climate-vulnerable developing countries	high	2	train
7942	AR6_WGIII	1776	27	The third headwind is rising financial and insurance sector risks and stresses (distinct from real ‘physical’ climate risks above) arising from the impacts of climate change, and systematically affecting both national and international financial institutions and raising their credit risks	high	2	train
7943	AR6_WGIII	1783	9	Climate finance in developing countries remains heavily concentrated in a few large economies	high	2	train
7944	AR6_WGIII	1783	10	Least-developed countries (LDCs), on the other hand, continue to represent less than 5% year-on-year	medium	1	train
7945	AR6_WGIII	1783	20	Mitigation continues to represent the lion’s share of global climate finance (consistently above 90% between 2017 and 2020), and in particular renewable energy, followed by energy efficiency and transport	high	2	train
7946	AR6_WGIII	1785	7	More generally, significant gaps remain to track climate finance comprehensively at a global level: • Available estimates are based on a good coverage of investments in renewable energy and, where available, energy efficiency and transport, while other sectors remain more difficult to track, such as industry, agriculture and land use	high	2	train
7947	AR6_WGIII	1785	10	Data on private and commercial finance remain very patchy, particularly for corporate financing (including debt financing provided by commercial banks), for which it is difficult to establish a link with activities and projects on the ground	high	2	train
7948	AR6_WGIII	1785	28	To avoid locking GHG emissions incompatible with remaining carbon budgets, this implies a rapid scaling down of new fossil fuel- related investments, combined with a scaling up of financing to allow energy and infrastructure systems to transition	high	2	train
7949	AR6_WGIII	1796	13	Estimated mitigation financing needs as a percentage of mean 2017–2020 GDP in USD 2015 comes in at around 2–4% for developed countries, and around 4-9% for developing countries	high	2	train
7950	AR6_WGIII	1796	15	This disparity is further exacerbated when considering adaptation, infrastructure and SDG-related investment needs	high	2	train
7951	AR6_WGIII	1796	24	Notably, climate finance flows to African countries might have even decreased for mitigation technology deployment (stagnated for adaptation between 2017 and 2020), widening the finance gap in African countries in the recent years	high	2	train
7952	AR6_WGIII	1798	29	Taking into account the inertia of the financial system as well as the magnitude of the challenge to align financial flows with the long-term global goals, fast action is required to ensure the readiness of the financial sector as an enabler of the transition	high	2	train
7953	AR6_WGIII	1799	18	On the one hand, unmitigated climate change implies an increased potential for adverse socio-economic impacts especially in more exposed economic activities and areas	high	2	train
7954	AR6_WGIII	1800	7	On the other hand, the mitigation of climate change, by means of a transition to a low- carbon economy, requires a transformation of the energy and production system at a pace and scale that implies adverse impacts on a range of economic activities, but also opportunities for some other activities	high	2	train
7955	AR6_WGIII	1800	38	Significant cost increases have been observed related to increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme events	high	2	train
7956	AR6_WGIII	1801	10	Fossil fuel reserve and resource estimates exceed in equivalent quantity of CO 2 with virtual certainty the carbon budget available to reach the 1.5°C and 2°C targets	high	2	train
7957	AR6_WGIII	1801	33	One outstanding challenge for the analysis of investors’ exposure to climate risks is the difficulty of gathering granular and standardised information on the breakdown of non-financial firms’ revenues and CAPEX in terms of low-/high- carbon activities	high	2	train
7958	AR6_WGIII	1802	10	One fundamental challenge is that climate-related financial risk is endogenous	high	2	train
7959	AR6_WGIII	1802	24	The endogeneity of risk and its associated deep uncertainty implies that the standard approach to financial risk, consisting of computing expected values and risk based on historical values of market prices, is not adequate for climate risk	high	2	train
7960	AR6_WGIII	1802	36	This development is key to mainstreaming the assessment of transition risk among financial institutions, but the following challenges emerge	high	2	train
7961	AR6_WGIII	1803	3	Global macroeconomic changes that may affect asset prices are expected to take place as a result of a possible reduction in growth or contraction of fossil fuel demand, in scenarios in which climate targets are met according to carbon budgets, but also following ongoing energy efficiency changes	high	2	train
7962	AR6_WGIII	1803	16	Due to the predominantly international nature of fossil fuel markets, assets may be at risk from regulatory and technological changes both domestically and in foreign countries	medium	1	train
7963	AR6_WGIII	1803	24	Framing climate risk as a financial risk (not just as an ethical issue) is key for it to become an actionable criterion for investment decision among mainstream investors	high	2	train
7964	AR6_WGIII	1805	6	The role of government is crucial for creating an enabling environment for climate (Clark 2018), and governments are critical in the launching and maintenance of this circle of trust by lowering the political, regulatory, macroeconomic and business risks	high	2	train
7965	AR6_WGIII	1805	12	Transparency: Policy de-risking measures, such as robust policy design and better transparency, as well as financial de-risking measures, such as green bonds and guarantees, at both domestic and international levels, enhance the attractiveness of clean energy investments	high	2	train
7966	AR6_WGIII	1805	14	However, risk disclosures alone would likely be insufficient as long as market failures that inhibit the emergence of low-carbon investment initiatives with positive risk-weighted returns	high	2	train
7967	AR6_WGIII	1805	17	Central banks in all economies will likely have to play a critical role in supporting the financing of fiscal operations, particularly in a post-COVID-19 world	high	2	train
7968	AR6_WGIII	1805	26	A green QE programme ‘would have the benefit of providing large amounts of additional liquidity to companies interested’ in green projects	medium	1	train
7969	AR6_WGIII	1805	33	Additional monetary policies and macroprudential financial regulation may facilitate the expected role of carbon pricing on boosting low-carbon investments	medium	1	train
7970	AR6_WGIII	1805	40	Despite increasing challenges to the theory (Sewell 2011), especially by repeated episodes of global financial crashes and crises, and other widely noted anomalies, a weaker form of the efficient markets hypothesis may still apply	medium	1	train
7971	AR6_WGIII	1806	44	As a result, low-carbon investments do not take place to socially and economically optimal levels, and the correct market signals would involve setting carbon prices high enough or equivalent trading in reduced carbon emissions by regulatory action to induce sufficient and faster shift towards low-carbon investments	high	2	train
7972	AR6_WGIII	1807	1	Carbon tax can be a simpler and easier way to implement carbon pricing, especially in developing countries, because countries can utilise the existing fiscal tools and do not need concrete enabling conditions as market-based frameworks	high	2	train
7973	AR6_WGIII	1807	39	There is a growing awareness of the low leverage ratio of public to private capital in climate blended finance (Blended Finance Taskforce 2018b) and of a ‘glass ceiling’, caused by a mix of agencies’ inertia and perceived loss of control over the use of funds, on the use of public guarantees by MDBs to increase it	high	2	train
7974	AR6_WGIII	1809	1	Limited prioritisation and agreement on prioritisation of sectors and/or project categories being ready and/or preferred for direct private sector involvement might become a challenge in the coming years	high	2	train
7975	AR6_WGIII	1809	15	A missing alignment of public funding and investment activity with the Paris Agreement (and Sustainable Development Goals) would result in significant carbon lock-ins, stranded assets and thus increase transition risks and ultimately economic costs of the transition	high	2	train
7976	AR6_WGIII	1809	21	Lessons from the global financial crises show that although deep economic crises create a sharp short-term emission drop, and green stimulus is argued to be the ideal response to tackle both the economic and the climate crises at once, disparities between regional strategies hinder the low-carbon transition	high	2	train
7977	AR6_WGIII	1809	32	Boosting investment should propel job creation, increasing household income and therefore demand across economic sectors	high	2	train
7978	AR6_WGIII	1809	35	First, only those countries and regions with highest credit-ratings (AAA or AA) with access to deep financial markets and excess savings will be able to mount such counter-cyclical climate investment paths, typically high-income developed economies	high	2	train
7979	AR6_WGIII	1810	6	Box 15.6 | Macroeconomics and Finance of a Post-COVID-19 Green Stimulus Economic Recovery Path Financial history suggests that capital markets may be willing to accommodate extended public borrowing for transient spending spikes (Barro 1987) when macroeconomic conditions suggest excess savings relative to private investment opportunities (Summers 2015) and when public spending is seen as timely, effective and productive, with governments able to repay when conditions improve as economic crisis conditions abate	high	2	train
7980	AR6_WGIII	1811	2	However, in terms of increase of supply of, in particular, public finance, often the debate is still driven by the question on affordability, considerations around financial debt sustainability and budgetary constraints against the background of macroeconomic headwinds – even more in the (post-)COVID-19 world	high	2	train
7981	AR6_WGIII	1811	3	The level of climate alignment of debt is hardly considered in debt-related regulation and/ or debt sustainability agreements like the Maastricht Treaty ceilings (3% of GDP government deficit and 60% of GDP (gross) government debt) not considering economic costs of deferred climate action as well as economic benefits of the transformation.Robust studies on the economic costs and benefits in the short- to long-term of reaching the LTGG exist for only few countries and/or regions, primarily in the developed world	high	2	train
7982	AR6_WGIII	1811	6	For many developing countries, the focus of debt sustainability discussions is on the negative effect of climate change on the future GDP and the uncertainty with regard to short-term effects of climate change and their economic implications	high	2	train
7983	AR6_WGIII	1812	6	Debt levels globally but particularly in developing and vulnerable countries have significantly increased over the past years with current and expected climate change impacts further burdening debt sustainability	high	2	train
7984	AR6_WGIII	1812	19	Definition of triggers is likely the most complex challenge in this context.The use of debt-for-nature and debt-for-climate-swaps is still very limited and not mainstreamed but offers significant potential if used correctly	high	2	train
7985	AR6_WGIII	1812	31	The debate around stranded assets focuses strongly on the loss of value to financial assets for investors (Section 15.6.1), however, stranded assets and resources in the context of the transition towards a low-emission economy ‘are expected to become a major economic burden for states and hence the tax payers’	high	2	train
7986	AR6_WGIII	1813	2	Late government action can delay action and consequently strengthen the magnitude of action needed at a later point in time with implications for employment and economic development in impacted regions requiring higher level of fiscal burden	high	2	train
7987	AR6_WGIII	1813	17	While there are questions about the sufficiency of insurance products to address the losses and damages of climate- related disasters, insurance can help to cover immediate needs directly, provide rapid response and transfer financial risk in times of extreme crisis	high	2	train
7988	AR6_WGIII	1814	4	Risk pooling among countries and regions is relatively advantageous when compared to conventional insurance because of the effective subsidising of ‘affected regions’ using revenues from unaffected regions which involve pooling among a large subset of countries	high	2	train
7989	AR6_WGIII	1814	8	At the same time, this approach has substantial basis risk (actual losses do not equal financial compensation)	high	2	train
7990	AR6_WGIII	1814	17	Increasingly, climate risk insurance schemes are being blended into disaster risk management as part of a comprehensive risk management approach	high	2	train
7991	AR6_WGIII	1814	27	There are also challenges with risk diversification, replication, and scalability	high	2	train
7992	AR6_WGIII	1815	13	Other gaps and challenges flagged by Kreft and Schäfer (2017) include limited coverage of the full spectrum of contingency risks experienced by countries, inadequate role of risk management as a standard for all regional pools, though there are some emerging best practices in terms of data provision on weather-related risks, and incentivisation of risk reduction	high	2	train
7993	AR6_WGIII	1815	40	It has transformative potential as a key enabler of inclusive urban economic development through the building of resilient communities	high	2	train
7994	AR6_WGIII	1816	7	The effect of deficit in investment for global infrastructure towards the growing subnational-level debt also creates pressure on subnational finances and constrains future access to financing	high	2	train
7995	AR6_WGIII	1816	22	PPPs are particularly important in cities with mature financial systems as the effectiveness of PPPs depends on appropriate investment architecture at scale and government capacity	high	2	train
7996	AR6_WGIII	1816	25	National-level investment vehicles can provide leadership for subnational climate financing and crowd in private finance by providing early-stage market support to technologies or evidence related to asset performance and costs-benefits	high	2	train
7997	AR6_WGIII	1816	27	Debt financing via subnational bonds and borrowing, including municipal bonds, is another potential tool for raising upfront capital, especially for rich cities	high	2	train

8015	AR6_WGIII	1823	16	Combining approaches: (i) developed countries meeting UNFCCC USD100 billion commitment on a grant-equivalent basis, (ii) stepped up technical assistance, (iii) infrastructure coordination, (iv) knowledge sharing by project preparation entities, and (iv) harnessing project risk facilities such as guarantees could be instrumental for scaling climate finance for Paris-SDGs	high	2	train
8016	AR6_WGIII	1824	13	Existing project risk facilities including guarantees could benefit from coordination, scaling and better reporting frameworks	high	2	train

8024	AR6_WGIII	1827	13	REDD+ can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation and also produce other co-benefits like climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and poverty reduction, if well-implemented	high	2	test
8025	AR6_WGIII	1827	45	The development of nature-based solutions faces barriers that relate to the value proposition, value delivery and value capture of nature- based solutions business models and sustainable sources of public/ private finance to tap into	high	2	train
8026	AR6_WGIII	1828	7	Policies and frameworks to expand and enhance financial inclusion also extend to the area of climate finance	high	2	train
8027	AR6_WGIII	1828	14	At the level of public multilateral climate funds, there have been significant improvements in integrating gender equality and women’s empowerment issues in the governance structures, policies, project approval and implementation processes of existing multilateral climate funds such as the UNFCCC’s funds managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the World Bank’s CIFs	high	2	train
8028	AR6_WGIII	1828	24	Overall, efforts to promote gender responsive/sensitive climate finance, at national and local levels, both in the public and private dimensions and more specifically in mitigation-oriented sectors such as clean and renewable energy, remain deficient	high	2	train
8029	AR6_WGIII	1863	1	Innovation has also led to, and exacerbated, trade-offs in relation to sustainable development	high	2	train
8030	AR6_WGIII	1863	4	The currently widespread implementation of solar photovoltaic (solar PV) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for instance, could not have happened without technological innovation	high	2	train
8031	AR6_WGIII	1863	7	Trade-offs include negative externalities – for instance, greater environmental pollution and social inequalities – rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and providers	high	2	train
8032	AR6_WGIII	1863	10	This systemic view of innovation takes into account the role of actors, institutions and their interactions, and can inform how innovation systems that vary across technologies, sectors and countries, can be strengthened	high	2	train
8033	AR6_WGIII	1863	19	A combination of scaled-up innovation investments with demand-pull interventions can achieve faster technology unit cost reductions and more rapid scale-up than either approach in isolation	high	2	train
8034	AR6_WGIII	1863	28	This inhibition occurs more often in developing countries	high	2	train
8035	AR6_WGIII	1863	30	Capabilities play a key role in these functions, the build-up of which can be enhanced by domestic measures, but also by international cooperation	high	2	train

8037	AR6_WGIII	1863	37	International diffusion of low-emission technologies is also facilitated by knowledge spillovers from regions engaged in clean R&D	medium	1	train
8038	AR6_WGIII	1863	39	Some literature suggests that it is a barrier, while other sources suggest that it is an enabler to the diffusion of climate-related technologies	medium	1	train
8039	AR6_WGIII	1864	4	These gaps could be filled by enhancing financial support for international technology cooperation, by strengthening cooperative approaches, and by helping build suitable capacity in developing countries across all technological innovation system functions	high	2	train
8040	AR6_WGIII	1864	6	For example, despite building a large market for mitigation technologies in developing countries, the lack of a systemic perspective in the implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism, operational since the mid- 2000s, has only led to some technology transfer, especially to larger developing countries, but limited capacity building and minimal technology development	medium	1	train
8041	AR6_WGIII	1864	9	Addressing both sets of challenges simultaneously presents multiple and recurrent obstacles that systemic approaches to technological change could help resolve, provided they are well managed	high	2	train

8048	AR6_WGIII	1870	55	In addition, the presence of spillovers implies that a unilateral effort to reduce emissions in one region could reduce emissions in other regions	medium	1	train
8049	AR6_WGIII	1917	20	In conjunction with other enabling conditions, technological innovation can support system transitions to limit warming, help shift development pathways, and bring about new and improved ways of delivering goods and services that are essential to human well-being	high	2	train
8050	AR6_WGIII	1917	22	Trade-offs include negative externalities, such as environmental impacts and social inequalities, rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even increases in emissions, and increased dependency on foreign knowledge and providers	high	2	train
8051	AR6_WGIII	1917	23	Digitalisation, for example, holds both opportunity for emission reduction and emission-saving behaviour change, but at the same time causes significant environmental, social and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts	high	2	train
8052	AR6_WGIII	1917	28	Like other enabling conditions, technological innovation plays a balancing role – by inhibiting change as innovation strengthens incumbent technologies and practices – and a reinforcing role, by allowing new technologies and practices to disrupt the existing socio-technical regimes	high	2	train
