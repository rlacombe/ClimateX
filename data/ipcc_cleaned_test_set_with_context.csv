A small decrease in productivity is evident globally for the period 1998–2015, but regional changes are larger and of opposing signs (low confidence). 2.3.4.2.3 Marine phenology Phenology is the study of the timing of important events in the annual life cycle of organisms (plants or animals; see also Annex VII: Glossary)."

There are indications from ocean-colour data used in conjunction with fisheries data that the survival rate of various larger marine organisms depends on phenological metrics related to the seasonality of phytoplankton growth. Such links have been demonstrated, for example, for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the North-west Atlantic (Platt et al., 2003); northern shrimp in the North Atlantic (Koeller et al., 2009; Ouellet et al., 2011); sardine (Sardinella aurita) off the Ivory coast (Kassi et al., 2018); cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae in the North-West Atlantic (Trzcinski et al., 2013); and oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps) off the south-west coast of India. Borstad et al. (2011) showed that fledgling production rate of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) on a remote island in coastal north-eastern Pacific was related to seasonal values of chlorophyll-a biomass in the vicinity of the island. In summary, new in situ data as well as satellite observations strengthen AR5 and SROCC findings that various phenological metrics for many species of marine organisms have changed in the last half century (high confidence), though many regions and many species of marine organisms remain under-sampled or even unsampled.

Figure 3.2c and Figure 3.4 show time series of anomalies in annually and globally averaged surface temperature simulated by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for the past millennium and the period 1850 to 2020, respectively, with the baseline set to 1850–1900 (see Section 1.4.1). As also indicated by Figure 3.4, the spread in simulated absolute temperatures is large (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). However, the discussion is based on temperature anomaly time series instead of absolute temperatures because our focus is on evaluation of the simulation of climate change in these models, and also because anomalies are more uniformly distributed and are more easily deseasonalized to isolate long-term trends (see Section 1.4.1). CMIP6 models broadly reproduce surface temperature variations over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows periods of intense volcanism (medium confidence) (Figure 3.2c). Simulated GMST anomalies are well within the uncertainty range of temperature reconstructions (medium confidence) since about the year 1300, except for some short periods immediately following large volcanic eruptions, for which simulations driven by different forcing datasets disagree (Figure 3.2c). Before the year 1300, larger disagreements between models and temperature reconstructions are expected because forcing and temperature reconstructions are increasingly uncertain further back in time, but specific causes have not been identified conclusively (Ljungqvist et al., 2019; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019) (medium confidence)."

Potential underestimation of volcanic (negative) forcing may have played a role (Outten et al., 2015). In the multi-model ensemble mean, the 1998–2012 GMST trends are almost equal in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1a), suggesting compensation by a higher transient climate response and equilibrium climate sensitivity in CMIP6 than CMIP5 (Section 7.5.6). To summarize, while there is medium confidence that natural forcing that was missing in CMIP5 contributed to the difference of observed and simulated GMST trends, confidence remains low in the quantitative contribution of net forcing updates. Energy budget and heat redistribution The early 21st century slower warming was observed in atmospheric temperatures, but the heat capacity of the atmosphere is very small compared to that of the ocean. Although there is noticeable uncertainty among observational products (H. Su et al., 2017) and observation quality changes through time, global ocean heat content continued to increase during the slower surface warming period (very high confidence), at a rate consistent with CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations (Sections 2.3.3.1, 3.5.1.3 and 7.2.2.2). There is high confidence that the Earth’s energy imbalance was larger in the 2000s than in the 1985–1999 period (Section 7.2.2.1), consistent with accelerating ocean heat uptake in the past two decades (Section 3.5.1.3)."

For the Southern Ocean in CMIP5, considerable fresh biases exist through the water column, and are most pronounced in the ventilated layers representing the subtropical mode and intermediate water masses (Sallée et al., 2013). A fresh bias in upper and intermediate layers of comparable magnitude is also seen in CMIP6 (Figure 3.25). The structure of the biases in the CMIP6 multi-model mean (which averages across many simulations with differing subsurface geographies and differing Southern Ocean salinity biases (Beadling et al., 2020)) is similar to that evident in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, but with slightly smaller magnitudes. The Arctic Ocean also on average exhibits a surface-enhanced fresh bias in the upper ocean (Figure 3.25), which is much larger than its Southern Hemisphere counterpart. In summary, the structure of the salinity biases in the multi-model mean has not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence), though there is limited evidence that the magnitude of subsurface biases has been reduced. Biases are sufficiently small to provide confidence in the utility of CMIP-class models for detection and attribution of ocean salinity.3.5.2.2 Salinity Change Attribution AR5 concluded that it was very likely that anthropogenic forcings had made a discernible contribution to surface and subsurface ocean salinity changes since the 1960s (Bindoff et al., 2013; Rhein et al., 2013)."

While observational sparsity considerably limits quantification of regional changes, a recent study by Friedman et al. (2017) assessed salinity changes in the Atlantic Ocean from 1896 to 2013 and confirmed the pattern of mid-to-low latitude enhanced salinity and high latitude North Atlantic freshening over this period exists even after accounting for the effects of the NAO and AMO. Considering the bulk of evidence, it is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed near-surface and subsurface salinity changes across the globe since the mid-20th century. All available multi-decadal assessments have confirmed that the associated pattern of change corresponds to fresh regions becoming fresher and salty regions becoming saltier (high confidence). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are only able to reproduce these patterns in simulations that include greenhouse gas increases (medium confidence).

The forced response is dependent on the strength, seasonal timing and location of the eruption but may also depend on the mean climate background state (Zanchettin et al., 2013) and/or the phases of the main modes of decadal variability such as the AMV (Section 3.7.7; Ménégoz et al., 2018). Finally, there is some evidence of an apparent signal-to-noise problem referred to as ‘paradox’ in seasonal and decadal hindcasts of the NAO over the period 1979–2018 (Scaife and Smith, 2018), which suggests that the NAO response to external forcing, SST or sea ice anomalies could be too weak in models. The weakness of the signal has been related to troposphere-stratosphere coupling which is too intermittent (O’Reilly et al., 2019b) and to chronic model biases in the persistence of NAO/NAM daily regimes, which is critically underestimated in coupled models (Strommen and Palmer, 2019; Zhang and Kirtman, 2019), and which does not exhibit significant improvement when model resolution is increased (Fabiano et al., 2020). Note, however, that the apparent signal-to-noise problem may be dependent on the period analysed over the 20th century, which questions its interpretation as a general characteristic of coupled models (Weisheimer et al., 2020). In summary, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are skilful in simulating the spatial features and the variance of the NAM/NAO and associated teleconnections (high confidence).

Human influence has likely contributed to the observed changes in humidity and precipitation (Section 3.3.2).

Permafrost thaw is included in the estimates, together with other feedbacks that are often not captured by models. Despite the large uncertainties surrounding the quantification of the effects of additional Earth system feedback processes, such as emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, these feedbacks represent identified additional amplifying risk factors that scale with additional warming and mostly increase the challenge of limiting warming to specific temperature thresholds.

In oxygen-depleted waters, microbial processes (denitrification and anammox, i.e., anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Kuypers et al., 2005; Codispoti, 2007; Gruber and Galloway, 2008) remove fixed nitrogen, and when upwelled waters reach the photic zone, primary production becomes nitrogen-limited (Tyrrell and Lucas, 2002). However, in other oceanic regions, increased water-column stratification due to warming may reduce the amount of N 2O reaching the surface and thereby decrease N 2O flux to the atmosphere. Landolfi et al. (2017) suggest that, by 2100, under the RCP8.5 scenario, total N 2O production in the ocean may decline by 5% and N 2O emissions be reduced by 24% relative to the pre-industrial era due to decreased organic matter export and anthropogenic-driven changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric N 2O concentrations.

The Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climte (SROCC) assessed with high confidence that ecosystems in the permafrost region act as carbon sinks during the summer growing season, and that wintertime carbon losses are significant, consistent with a multi-decadal small increase in CO 2 emissions during early winter at Barrow, Alaska (Sweeney et al., 2016; Webb et al., 2016; Meredith et al., 2019). These findings have been further strengthened by recent comprehensive synthesis of in-situ wintertime flux observations that show large carbon losses during the non- growing season (Natali et al., 2019). Increased autumn and winter respiration are a key large-scale fingerprint of top-down permafrost thaw predicted by ecosystem models (Parazoo et al., 2018). However, the length of these wintertime observational records is too short to unequivocally determine whether winter carbon losses are higher now than they used to be.

Consequently, on time scales longer than about 30 years, the net long-term global temperature effects of sectors and regions are dominated by CO 2 (high confidence). The global mean temperature response following a climate change mitigation measure that affects emissions of both short‑ and long‑lived climate forcers depends on their atmospheric decay times, how fast and for how long the emissions are reduced, and the inertia in the climate system. For SLCFs including methane, the rate of emissions drives the long‑term global temperature effect, as opposed to CO 2 for which the long‑term global temperature effect is controlled by the cumulative emissions. About 30 years or more after a one‑year emission pulse occurs, the sectors contributing the most to global warming are industry, fossil fuel combustion for energy and land transportation, essentially through CO 2 (high confidence).

This means that for SLCFs including methane, the rate of emissions drives the long‑term stabilisation, as opposed to CO 2 where the long‑term effect is controlled by cumulative emissions (Allen et al., 2018b). Methods to compare rates of SLCF emissions with cumulative CO 2 emissions are discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.6.1.4). As a consequence, in idealized ESM studies that assume an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or fossil fuel‑related emissions, a rapid change in aerosol levels occurs leading to large increases in GSAT with the rate of warming lasting for several years. Similarly, the thermal inertia causes the pulse emissions (Figure 6.15) of SLCFs to have a significant effect on surface temperature even after 10 years. In summary, for SLCFs with short lifetime (e.g., months), the response in surface temperature occurs strongly as soon as a sustained change in emissions is implemented and continues to grow for a few years, primarily due to thermal inertia in the climate system (high confidence). Near its maximum, the response slows down but will then take centuries to reach equilibrium (high confidence)."

Huang et al., 2020). CMIP6 models agree on a future decrease of the equatorial zonal temperature gradient (Fredriksen et al., 2020), which can lead to weaker trade winds over the tropical Pacific. However, CMIP6 models show a diversity of SST warming patterns in the tropical Pacific (Freund et al., 2020), which contributes to uncertainties in the response of both Walker circulation and ENSO to continued warming.

At regional scale, salinity biases are at least partially a result of inaccurate ocean dynamics (Levang and Schmitt, 2020). Despite the regional limitations, Section 3.5.2.2 assesses that, at the global scale, it is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed surface and subsurface salinity changes since the mid-20th century (strengthened from the very likely AR5 assessment). The SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) assessed that projected salinity changes in the subsurface ocean reflect changes in the rates of formation of water masses or their newly formed properties. Additional consistent newer evidence based on CMIP5 and regional climate models confirms that 21st century projections adhere to the ‘fresh gets fresher, salty gets saltier’ paradigm, through subduction of freshening high-latitude waters into the ventilated water masses in both hemispheres in the Pacific, Indian and Southern Ocean – especially the Arctic and upper Southern Ocean, and saltier subtropical and Mediterranean surface waters – lead to saltier pycnoclines and North Atlantic mode water (Metzner et al., 2020; Parras-Berrocal et al., 2020; Silvy et al., 2020; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020).

Compared to observations or to eddy-present and eddy-rich models, the eddy- parameterized models from CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulate weaker and wider WBCs, as well as less realistic locations of subtropical and subpolar gyre boundaries (Figure 9.11). Increased resolution admits mesoscale eddies, and also improves simulation of the strength and position of WBCs such as the Kuroshio Current, Gulf Stream, and East Australian Current (very high confidence) (Sasaki et al., 2004; Chassignet and Marshall, 2008; Delworth et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012; Small et al., 2014; Haarsma et al., 2016; Chassignet et al., 2017, 2020; Hewitt et al., 2020). Improved boundary current location relates to improved recirculation regions (Jayne et al., 2009), mean path and variability, and existence of multiple stable paths (Qiu et al., 2005; Delman et al., 2015), air–sea fluxes (Small et al., 2014), and related coastal weather patterns (Kaspi and Schneider, 2011). The wind-current feedback, implemented by considering relative velocity of currents and wind, realistically dampens mesoscale eddies and WBCs, through mesoscale air–sea interaction (Ma et al., 2016; Renault et al., 2016, 2019), even though sub-mesoscale wind- current damping feedback is missing in these models (medium confidence) (Z.

As eddies potentially play a role in determining the strength of gyre circulations and their low- frequency variability (Fox-Kemper and Pedlosky, 2004; Berloff et al., 2007), it is expected that eddy-present and eddy-rich models will differ in their decadal variability and sensitivity to changes in the wind stress of gyres from eddy-parameterized models (medium confidence).

Direct estimation of oceanic upward transport (Oyarzún and Brierley, 2019; Sylla et al., 2019) and nutrient flux into the euphotic layer (Jacox et al., 2018) provide a meaningful estimator of upwelling, integrating all relevant processes, including changes in wind stress curl.

Change in upper-ocean stratification (Section 9.2.1.3) is projected to increase confinement of upwelling vertical velocities to near the ocean surface (high confidence) (Oerder et al., 2015; Oyarzún and Brierley, 2019). In summary, SROCC and this Report conclude that the California Current system has experienced some upwelling-favourable wind intensification since the 1980s (high confidence), while low agreement among reported wind changes in the Benguela, Canary, and Humboldt systems prevent a similar assessment.

This is the case as the regional trends in the maximum northward extent of the ice cover (Figure 9.15) are determined by the balance between the northward advection of the ice that is formed in polynyas near the continental margin, and the lateral and subsurface melting through oceanic heat fluxes. The advection of the sea ice is strongly correlated with winds and cyclones (Schemm, 2018; Vichi et al., 2019; Alberello et al., 2020). Accordingly, the increasing sea ice area in the Ross Sea can be linked to a strengthening of the Amundsen Sea low (e.g., Holland et al., 2017b, 2018), while other regional sea ice trends in the austral autumn can be linked to changes in westerly winds, cyclone activity and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in summer and spring (Doddridge and Marshall, 2017; Holland et al., 2017a; Schemm, 2018). In addition to the wind-driven changes, increased near-surface ocean stratification (Section 9.2.1.3) has contributed to the observed increase in sea ice coverage (e.g., Purich et al., 2018; L. Zhang et al., 2019) as it tends to cool the surface ocean (Sections 9.2.1.1 and 9.2.3.2).

The slow response of the deep ocean to forcing leads to global-mean thermosteric sea level fall occurring long afterward, even if CO 2 levels are restored after a transient increase: global mean thermosteric sea level rise takes more than a millennium to reverse (Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2018). Rapid reversion to pre-industrial CO 2 concentrations has been found to be ineffective at fostering regrowth of the AIS (DeConto et al., 2021) but may reduce the multimillennial sea level commitment (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Altering sub-ice-shelf bathymetry (Wolovick and Moore, 2018) or triggering ice shelf advance through massive snow deposition (Feldmann et al., 2019) might interrupt marine ice sheet instability (Section 9.4.2.4) and thus reduce sea level commitment. A reversion to pre-industrial Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures with solar radiation modification is projected to stop mass loss in Greenland but leads to minimal regrowth (Applegate and Keller, 2015).

Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators outperform uncorrected output of global and regional models for a range of statistical aspects at single locations due to their calibration (Casanueva et al., 2016), but RCMs are superior when spatial fields are relevant (Mehrotra et al., 2014; Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Maraun et al., 2019a). Similarly, there is some evidence that bias adjustment is comparable in performance when applied to global models and dynamically downscaled global models only for single locations, but dynamical downscaling prior to bias adjustment clearly adds value once spatial dependence is relevant (Maraun et al., 2019a). These results may explain why dynamical downscaling does not add value to global model simulations for (single-site) agricultural modelling, when both global and regional models are bias adjusted (Glotter et al., 2014), but dynamical downscaling adds value compared to bias-adjusted global model output for spatially distributed hydrological models (Qiao et al., 2014).

On land, changing rainfall patterns and repeated heat waves may interact with biological factors such as altered plant growth and nutrient allocation under elevated CO 2, affecting herbivore rates and insect outbreaks leading to the widespread dieback of some forests (e.g., in Australian eucalypt forests) (Gherlenda et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2019a).

It assesses differential sensitivities among life stages within individual organisms, changing responses across scales of biological organisation and the potential for evolutionary adaptation to climate change (e.g., Przeslawski et al., 2015; Boyd et al., 2018; Reddin et al., 2020), providing examples and identifying key gaps and uncertainties that limit our ability to project the ecological impact of multiple climate-induced drivers (Figure 3.8a). The assessment includes physiological responses to single environmental drivers and their underlying mechanisms (Section 3.3.2), the characteristics of multiple drivers and organisms’ responses to them (Section 3.3.3), short-term acclimation and longer-term evolutionary adaptation of populations (Section 3.3.4), and it concludes with an assessment of progress in upscaling laboratory findings to ecosystems within in situ settings (Figure 3.8b; Section 3.3.5). 3.3.2 Responses to Single Drivers Anthropogenic CO 2 emissions trigger a suite of changes that alter ocean temperature, pH and CO 2 concentration, oxygen concentration and nutrient supply at global scales (Section 3.2). The response pathways of these climate-induced drivers have been investigated primarily as single variables. Temperature affects the movement and transport of molecules and, thereby, the rates of all biochemical reactions; thus, ongoing and projected warming (Section 3.2.2.1) that remains below an organism’s physiological optimum will generally raise metabolic rates (very high confidence) (Pörtner et al., 2014). Beyond this optimum (T opt; Figure 3.9), metabolism typically decreases sharply, finally reaching a critical threshold (T crit) beyond which enzymes become thermally inactivated and cells undergo oxidative stress."

Seems to be missing specific info ,"In marine ecosystems, rising metabolic rates due to warming will be restricted to primary producers in high- nutrient regions","Phosphorus limitation lowers the temperature optimum for growth of phytoplankton, making these organisms more prone to heat stress (Thomas et al., 2017; Bestion et al., 2018). This trend may hold for open-ocean phytoplankton, which are often iron- limited (medium confidence) (Boyd, 2019). Such temperature-nutrient interactions might be especially relevant during summer MHWs (Section 3.2.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2; IPCC, 2018; Holbrook et al., 2019; DeCarlo et al., 2020; Hayashida et al., 2020), when primary producers are often nutrient-limited and near their thermal limits. Increasingly frequent and intense MHWs along with projected decreases in nutrient availability (Section 3.2.3.3) may push some primary producers beyond tolerance thresholds. Temperature– nutrient interactions can also alter the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio in phytoplankton (Marañón et al., 2018). Overall, rising metabolic rates due to warming will be restricted to primary producers in high- nutrient regions (medium confidence) (Thomas et al., 2017; Marañón et al., 2018).

There is further evidence that observed alterations in fish olfactory behaviour 3 407Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and Their Services Chapter 3 under ocean acidification may result from physiological and molecular changes of the olfactory epithelium, influencing olfactory receptors (Roggatz et al., 2016; Porteus et al., 2018; Velez et al., 2019; Mazurais et al., 2020). Temperature mainly drives metabolic processes and thus energetic requirements, which can indirectly influence behaviour, including increased risk-taking during feeding (Marangon et al., 2020). Ocean warming also accelerates the biochemical reactions and metabolic processes that are primarily influenced by acidification. It is therefore difficult to generalise to what extent co-occurring ocean warming ameliorates or exacerbates effects of acidification on behaviour (Laubenstein et al., 2019); outcomes depend upon species and life stage (Faleiro et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2016; Tills et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018b; Jarrold et al., 2020), interactions between species (e.g., Paula et al., 2019) along with confounding factors including food availability and salinity (medium confidence) (Ferrari et al., 2015; Pistevos et al., 2015; Pimentel et al., 2016; Pistevos et al., 2017; Horwitz et al., 2020).

Polar organisms’ sensitivity to ocean acidification may increase with increasing light levels due to the loss of sea ice (algae; Donahue et al., 2019; Kvernvik et al., 2020), temperature stress (pteropods; Johnson and Hofmann, 2020) or indirectly via increased heterotrophic bacterial productivity (limited evidence) (Vaqué et al., 2019). Due to limited mechanistic understanding of observed effects, and mixed responses among Arctic species, future impacts of ocean acidification are assigned medium confidence for polar species and low confidence for outcomes for polar ecosystems (Meredith et al., 2019; Green et al., 2021b).

Projections from coupled biogeochemical and ecosystem models suggest a general decline in mesopelagic biomass (Lefort et al., 2015), although this may vary among ocean basins. The volume of OMZs have been expanding at many locations (high confidence), and the oxygen content of the subsurface ocean is projected to decline to historically unprecedented conditions over the 21st century (medium confidence) (Section 3.2.3.2; WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021) at a rate of 10–15 µM per decade in OMZs (Section 3.2.3.2; Breitburg et al., 2018). Oxygen availability and the effects of ocean acidification (Sections 3.3, 3.4.2) on zooplankton might become a dominant constraint in the upper ocean’s metabolic index, which is projected to decrease globally by 20% by 2100 (Deutsch et al., 2015; Steinberg and Landry, 2017). In addition, extremely rapid acceleration of climate velocities projected in the mesopelagic under all emissions scenarios suggest that species in this ocean stratum will be even more exposed to future warming than species in the epipelagic (Figure 3.4; Brito-Morales et al., 2020).

A summary of previous assessments of abrupt ecosystem shifts and extreme events is provided in Table 3.21. Abrupt ecosystem shifts are associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability (Alheit et al., 2019; Beaugrand et al., 2019; Lehodey et al., 2020), some of which are projected to intensify with climate change (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter 1; Wang et al., 2017a; Collins et al., 2019a; Chen et al., 2021). Over the past 60 years, abrupt ecosystem shifts have generally followed El Niño/ Southern Oscillation events of any strength, but some periods had geographically limited ecological shifts (~0.25% of the global ocean in 1984–1987) and others more extensive shifts (14% of the global ocean in 2012–2015) (medium confidence) (Figure 3.19b; Beaugrand et al., 2019). Typically, interacting drivers, such as eutrophication and overharvest, reduce ecosystem resilience to climate extremes (e.g., MHWs, cyclones) or gradual warming, and hence promote ecosystem shifts (high confidence) (Figure 3.19a; Rocha et al., 2015; Biggs et al., 2018; Babcock et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2020b; Bergstrom et al., 2021; Canadell and Jackson, 2021; Tait et al., 2021).

Globally, droughts affected both harvested areas and yields, with a reported cereal production loss of 9–10% due to weather extremes between 1964 and 2007. Yield losses were greater by about 7% during recent droughts (1985–2007) due to greater damage—reducing harvested area—compared to losses from earlier droughts (1964–1984), with 8–11% greater losses in high-income countries than in low-income ones (Lesk et al., 2016). Globally, between 1961 and 2006, it has been estimated that 25% yield loss occurred, with yield loss probability increasing by 22% for maize, 9% for rice and 22% for soybean under drought conditions (Leng and Hall, 2019). Mean climate and climate extremes are responsible for 20–49% of yield anomalies variance, with 18–45% of this variance attributable to droughts and heatwaves (Vogel et al., 2019). Drought has been singled out as a major driver of yield reductions globally (high confidence) (Lesk et al., 2016; Meng et al., 2016; Zipper et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2019; Leng and Hall, 2019).

Wu et al. (2020) reported a projected increase in future groundwater storage in the semiarid regions of northwest India, North China Plain, the Guarani Aquifer in South America and Canning Basin in Australia due to significant increases in projected precipitation, but the models do not consider local hydrogeological characteristics. However, the projected irrigation expansion could negate this positive gain in groundwater storage (Sishodia et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). In drylands (e.g., playas in the southwestern USA), where focused groundwater recharge processes dominate, greater recharge is projected to occur from the increased number of significant runoff-generating extreme precipitation events in the future (McKenna and Sala, 2018).

Further understanding the constraints and limits that exist with regard to adaptation in the water sector is becoming urgent in light of increasing slow (e.g., droughts) and rapid (e.g., floods) onset impacts associated with climate change. Taking action towards adaptation critically determines the outcomes and impacts of climate change processes across space and time. Where efforts to reduce risk do not effectively occur, losses and damages occur as a consequence of climate change, some of which can have irreversible and existential effects (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Page and Heyward, 2016; Thomas and Benjamin, 2018a; Mechler et al., 2019).

Projected thermal increases of 1.5°C will reduce ecosystem services, further reduced under 2°C warming, with associated increases in acidification, hypoxia, dead zones, flooding and water restrictions (medium confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Sudden production losses from extreme climate events can exacerbate food security challenges across production sectors, including aquaculture, increasing global hunger (high confidence) (Cottrell et al., 2019; Food Security Information Network, 2020). While aquaculture provides positive influences such as food security and livelihoods, there are negative concerns over environmental impacts (including high nutrient loads from sites) and socioeconomic conflicts (Alleway et al., 2019; Soto et al., 2019), and adoption of ecosystem approaches is dependent on particular user groups and regions (Gentry et al., 2017; Brugère et al., 2019; Gentry et al., 2020).

Species diversification through co-culture, integrated aquaculture– agriculture (e.g., rice–fish) or integrated multi-trophic culture (e.g., shrimp–tilapia–seaweed or finfish–bivalve–seaweed) may maintain farm long-term performance and viability by: creating new aquaculture opportunities; promoting societal and environmental stability; reducing GHG emissions through reduced feed usage and waste; and carbon sequestration (medium confidence) (see Section 5.10, Ahmed et al., 2017; Bunting et al., 2017; Gasco et al., 2018, Soto et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2019; Dubois et al., 2019; FAO, 2019c; Li et al., 2019; Freed et al., 2020; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Prasko et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020). In practice, most aquaculture operations concentrate on single-species systems (Metian et al., 2020), and barriers such as land availability, freshwater resources and lack of credit access may limit the uptake and success of integrated adaptation approaches to climate change (Ahmed et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2020; Kais and Islam, 2021).

The deployment of such technocratic approaches at the local scale is detrimental for democratic and collaborative practices (Metzger and Lindblad, 2020). For example, while China has received praise in terms of delivering urban policies that put climate change at its core, thus suggesting its role providing leadership in climate change debates (Liu et al., 2014; Wang and He, 2015; Fu and Zhang, 2017), other analyses suggest that processes of planning should take greater account of certain groups and interests (Westman and Broto, 2018). Urban sustainability policy may, as a result, fail to deliver collaborative social and environmental objectives, and this is maladaptive in terms of CRD. 6.4.3.2 Moves from Mainstreaming to Transformative Adaptation Two forms of mainstreaming are usually found in urban policy: incorporating climate adaptation into different sectors or incorporating climate adaptation in holistic sustainability or resilience plans, linking climate adaptation objectives with other social and development objectives (Reckien et al., 2019; Fainstein, 2018). The integration of climate adaptation in local policies in cities and settlements has often been seen as maintaining business-as-usual and not always aligned with transformative efforts to address structural drivers of vulnerability (high confidence).

The economic impacts of droughts have been associated with increases in suicide, particularly among farmers (Carleton, 2017; Edwards et al., 2015; Vins et al., 2015); those whose occupations are likely to be affected by climate change report that it is a source of stress that is linked to substance abuse and suicidal ideation (Kabir, 2018). Studies of Indigenous Peoples often describe food insecurity or reduced access to traditional foods as a link between climate change and reduced mental health (Middleton et al., 2020b). The loss of family members, for example due to an extreme weather event, increases the risk of mental illness (Keyes et al., 2014). Individuals in low- and middle-income countries may be more severely impacted due to lesser access to mental health services and lower financial resources to help cope with impacts compared with high-income countries (Abramson et al., 2015). Anxiety about the potential risks of climate change and awareness of climate change itself can affect mental health even in the absence of direct impacts (low confidence). There is a need for more evidence about the prevalence or severity of climate change-related anxiety, sometimes called ecoanxiety, but national surveys in the USA, Europe and Australia show that people express high levels of concern and perceived harm associated with climate change (Steentjes et al., 2017; Clayton and Karazsia, 2020; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Helm et al., 2018; Leiserowitz et al., 2017; Reser et al., 2012; Steentjes et al., 2017)."

This section assesses future risks associated with changes in the frequency and/or severity of storms, floods, droughts, extreme heat, wildfires and other events assessed in Section 7.2 that currently affect migration and displacement patterns, as well as the impacts of emerging hazards, including average temperature increases that may affect the habitability of settlements in arid regions and the tropics, and sea level rise and associated hazards that threaten low- lying coastal settlements. Studies assessed here consider projected changes in future exposure to hazards over a variety of geographical and temporal periods, with some considering changes in population numbers in exposed areas. The uneven distribution of exposure of age cohorts is typically overlooked in existing research. For example, people younger than age 10 in the year 2020 are projected to experience a nearly four-fold increase in extreme events under 1.5°C of global warming and a five-fold increase under 3°C warming; such increases in exposure would not be experienced by a person of the age of 55 in 2020 in their remaining lifetime under any warming scenario (Thiery et al., 2021).7.3.2.1 Region-Specific Changes in Climatic Risks As outlined in 7.2, the most common drivers of observed climate- related migration and displacement are extreme storms (particularly tropical cyclones), floods and droughts (high confidence). The future frequency and/or severity of such events due to anthropogenic climate change are expected to vary by region according to future GHG emission pathways (Naik et al 2021; Regional Chapters, this report), with there being an increased potential for compound effects of successive or multiple hazards (e.g., tropical storms accompanied by extreme heat events (Matthews et al., 2019))."

(Reisinger et al., 2014) Key risks include changes in the structure and composition of Australian coral reefs, loss of montane ecosystems, increased flood damage, reduced water resources in southern Australia, more deaths and infrastructure damage during heatwaves, more fire-related impacts on ecosystems and settlements in southern Australia and across New Zealand, greater risk to coastal infrastructure and ecosystems and reduced water availability in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and southern Australia (high confidence). Benefits are projected for some sectors and locations (high confidence), including reduced winter mortality and energy demand for heating, increased forest growth and enhanced pasture productivity. Adaptation is occurring and becoming mainstreamed in some planning processes (high confidence). Adaptive capacity is considered generally high in many human systems, but adaptation implementation faces major barriers, especially for transformational responses (high confidence). Some synergies and trade-offs exist between different adaptation responses and between mitigation and adaptation, with interactions occurring both within and outside the region (very high confidence).

Temperature anomalies ranged from 1.2°C to 4.0°C and durations ranged from 90–250 days (Table 11.2). Ocean carbon storage and acidification has led to decreased surface pH in the region (Table 11.2), including the sub-Antarctic waters off the East Coast of New Zealand’s South Island (very high confidence) (Law et al., 2016).

Given the dense population of insular hotspots (~31.8% of existing humans within ~15.9% of inhabited global land area) and the fact that on many islands, large proportions of human populations live within coastal regions, it has been suggested that immense impacts from such relocations should be factored into projection and adaptation studies (Wetzel et al., 2012).

Antarctic and Arctic systems support some of the world’s largest fisheries, including those for Antarctic krill and Arctic walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), which constitute a critical source of protein and macronutrients to a growing population of seafood consumers, as well as various aquaculture and livestock feeds (Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE in Chapter 5) (Table CCP6.4) (Huntington et al., 2013; Raheem, 2018; Hicks et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2019; FAO, 2020; Cavanagh et al., 2021; Grant et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2021). Marine sources of protein and nutrition are important in transformational future scenarios where dietary shifts and provisioning policies provide multiple co-benefits to equity, food security and carbon mitigation (Springmann et al., 2016; Poore and Nemecek, 2018; Thiault et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020).

Assessing risk and limits requires in-depth analysis of the adaptability of human and natural systems under different warming and risk levels, also considering socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability drivers, informed by perspectives on what breaching limits means, especially if significant change and losses and damages occur (Sections 16.4, 8.4). Assessments differ between natural systems (where adaptation potential is often very limited; Klein et al., 2014) and human systems where incremental and transformational adaptation can help to extend soft limits so that hard limits are not met or to buy time until hard limits are reached with higher levels of warming. The assessment synthesises global and regional evidence across regional and thematic report chapters along a continuum from observed to projected impacts and risks, the spectrum of incremental and transformational adaptation, and finally any evidence on soft and hard limits. We present regional evidence for two types of salient natural and human systems and RKRs: RKR-B (risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems), where we assess risks from marine heatwaves to coral reefs; and RKR- E (risk of heat on human health as a human system).

This method can enable prospective evaluation of future whole-of-management scenarios described in this chapter. 17.3.2 Integration across Portfolios of Adaptation Responses In recent years, methods for simultaneously considering multiple societal and sectoral objectives, climate risks and adaptation options have been emerging, often termed ‘integrated’ approaches (Hadka et al., 2015; Garner et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2017; Giupponi and Gain, 2017a; Stelzenmuller et al., 2018; Marchau et al., 2019). Different decision-making approaches can be complementary (Kwakkel et al., 2016), and multiple approaches will be needed to manage risks across sectors, in space and over short to long time scales (Section 17.6). Higher-level integration was first presented in the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) (Burton et al., 2012; Lal et al., 2012; O’Brien et al., 2012) and includes concepts of planning, coordination and mainstreaming (Lal et al., 2012), consideration of cross-scale dynamics and nested vulnerabilities (Klein et al., 2014), and decision- making across governments and sectors (Denton et al., 2014; Mimura et al., 2014). Since AR5, recognition of the importance of using integrated adaptation to improve climate risk management across the nexus between many sectors and across regions has increased (high confidence) (Harrison et al., 2016; Challinor et al., 2018). This was highlighted in the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (Hurlbert et al., 2019); advanced planning and integration of adaptation responses are needed over many levels (medium confidence) (Göpfert et al., 2019; Section 17.6; Woodruff and Regan, 2019)."

For example, the level of GDP is often equated with levels of social welfare, even though as a measure of market output, it can be an inadequate metric for gauging well-being over time, particularly in its environmental and social dimensions (Van den Bergh, 2007; Stiglitz et al., 2009). The result of this broad framing linking economic growth to human well- being has been decades of policies, programmes and projects aimed at growing economies at scales from the household to regional and global. However, linking development to past and current modes of economic growth creates significant challenges for CRD, as it implies that the very processes that have contributed to current climate challenges, including economic growth and the resource use and energy regimes it relies upon, are also the pathways to improvements in human well-being. This places climate resilience and development in opposition to one another. While there are many possible successful pathways to future development in the context of climate change, history shows that pathways positive for the vast majority of people typically induce significant impacts and costs, especially on marginal and vulnerable people (high confidence) (Hickel, 2017). Frequently, considerations for social difference and equity are side-lined in these processes, for example through the assumption that a growing economy lifts opportunity for all, further marginalising those who are the most vulnerable to climate change (Matin et al., 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019)."

This inadvertent impact on equity appears to fundamentally contradict a benevolent understanding of transformative adaptation that also champions social justice (Patterson et al., 2018), thus posing long-term maladaptation in opposition to transformative adaptation (Magnan et al., 2020). Similarly, mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions, can also increase climate impacts vulnerability and undermine adaptation efforts. The same can be said for some poverty alleviation and sustainable development efforts that increase vulnerability for specific segments of the population. For example, in Central America, an evaluation of 12 rural renewable energy projects (either forthe clean development mechanism, early warning systems or rural electrification goals) found that some mitigation and poverty alleviation projects increased vulnerability to families—by excluding them, not adhering to local safety and quality codes and standards, or significantly altering community power dynamics and contributing to conflict (Ley, 2017; Ley et al., 2020). Synergies between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development might be promoted by prioritising those CRD strategies most likely to generate synergies (very high confidence) (Roy et al., 2018; Karlsson et al., 2020).

In addition, an extensive literature now argues that current patterns of development, and the economic systems underpinning that development, are unsustainable (Washington and Twomey, 2016), and thus economic growth may not necessarily continue indefinitely in the absence of more concerted effort to pursue sustainable development, including reducing the impacts of climate change. Given such criticisms of the link between development and economic growth, a growing number of researchers argue for the need for alternatives to GDP to guide development and evaluate the costs and benefits of different policy interventions (Hilmi et al., 2015).
