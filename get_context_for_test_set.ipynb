      "Water management for reducing drought and adapting to climate change is important issue (high confidence)± Probably no direct impact (soil–human health nexus through nutritional transfer: may contribute to better nutrient security through quality and nutrient-rich products and better living if higher prof- its and diversified products) (medium confidence)+ Better landscape water balance by influencing the quality and availability of water supply (high confidence)+ Better soil management can lead to improved productivity and thus economic growth (medium confidence)± Low environment footprints, quality and healthy food production and economic and social viability (high confidence)+ Clear climate benefit (high confidence)+ Better sponge function to life in water, and less nutrients into the water (medium confidence)+ Proved beneficial for combating soil degradation and improving soil health and beneficial to biodiversity (high confidence)+ Securing local food production and higher and stable profits may reduce migration and prevent conflict and support peace and justice (medium confidence)Sections 7.3, 7.4 and 7.6Almost not context or scale dependent. Low-cost option, high level of technol- ogy readiness. Difficulty in monitoring. Trade-offs with other uses of the organic matter Reduce CH 4 and N2O emissions in agriculture± When part of improved agricul- ture, it may reduce hunger (low confidence)+ Cleaner air and soil-plant-herbivore nexus (high confidence)± Less use of water and less manure into water streams (low confidence)± Requires innova- tive food production (low confidence)+ Reduction of emissions (which is a part of responsible production) (medium confidence)+ Clear reduction of emissions (high confidence)+ Less impact on water (high confidence)+ Less impact on land (high confidence)Section 7.4Risks include mitigation persistence, ecological impacts associated with improving feed quality and supply, or potential toxicity and animal welfare issues concerning feed additives Reduced conver - sion of forests and other ecosystems (deforestation, loss and degrada- tion of peatlands and coastal wetlands)± Protecting huge areas may lead to poverty (medium confidence)– May lead to some competition for land (medium confi- dence)+ Cleaner air, greener environ- ment generally leads to better health (high confidence)+ Better landscape water balance (high confidence)± May lead to competition for land and less economic benefits (medium confidence)± When surrounding cities, it may lead to cooling (high confidence)+ Clear climate benefit (high confidence)+ Better sponge function to life in water, and less nutrients into the water (high confidence)+ Beneficial to biodiversity (high confidence)± May lead to more competition for resources and thus pressures between actors (medium confidence)± May lead to joint forces (low confidence)Section 7.4Many benefits in terms of climate and biodiversity. It can compete for land and thus with food provision Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, afforestation+ If it provides income, food and wood products, then neutral to positive (medium confidence)± May lead to competition for land when done at large scales. Refor - estation and forest restoration can have co-benefits for food security (medium confidence)+ Cleaner air, greener environ- ment generally leads to better health (medium confidence)± Better landscape water balance. Afforestation (on naturally unforested land) can compound climate-related risks to water security (medium confidence)– May lead to competition for land and less economic benefits (medium confidence)± When done with involvement of locals it can reduce inequality (low confidence)+ When surrounding cities, it may lead to cooling (high confidence)+ Clear climate benefit (high confidence)+ Better sponge function to life in water when done in proper manner (high confidence)+ Beneficial to biodiversity when done in proper manner (medium confidence)Section 7.4Very much context dependent and on how measures are carried out.\n"
